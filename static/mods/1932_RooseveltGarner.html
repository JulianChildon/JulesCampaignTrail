Farley have formally declared their candidacies for the Democratic nomination for president, which has set the stage for an unprecedented primary contest against incumbent President Franklin Roosevelt. The announcements come amidst growing concerns within the Democratic Party over Roosevelt’s potential decision to seek a third term, a move that breaks with a tradition dating back to George Washington.</p><p>From the onset of your second term, you recognize that the chances of being renominated are quite slim. Still, you at least push through your narrowly tailored recovery agenda through Congress, even as the people yearn for more.</p><p>John Nance Garner, a veteran of nearly four decades in public service, is a staunch advocate for fiscal conservatism and limited government. Garner, who served as Speaker of the House before joining Roosevelt’s ticket in 1932, has grown increasingly critical of the New Deal’s expansive programs. In a statement announcing his campaign, Garner said: "The presidency is a sacred trust, not a personal entitlement. I am running to restore balance to our government and to ensure that the principles of democracy remain intact for future generations."</p><p>James A. Farley, often credited as the architect of Roosevelt’s electoral successes in 1932 and 1936, has had a falling out with the President, and his break with Roosevelt stems largely from the president’s decision to seek a third term, a move Farley has publicly criticized as a breach of democratic precedent. "The Democratic Party belongs to the people, not to any one man," Farley said in a statement. "This race is about preserving the traditions and values that have made our party a force for good in this country.</p><p>President Roosevelt has yet to formally announce his candidacy but is widely expected to seek reelection, citing the ongoing economic recovery and mounting global tensions as reasons for continuity in leadership. Roosevelt’s supporters argue that his leadership during the Great Depression and his efforts to prepare the nation for potential involvement in the war in Europe justify his decision to pursue a third term. However, the president’s critics within the party, including Garner and Farley, contend that breaking the two-term precedent threatens the balance of power and sullies the democratic principle of rotational leadership.</p><p>This is the first time in modern history that a sitting president faces significant challenges from within his own party, and specifically from his own vice president. Party insiders warn that a divided convention could weaken the Democratic ticket in the general election.</p>`)

Roosevelt and Glass never reconciled, as Roosevelt helped Wilkie form a "Liberal Party", which was elected in 1944.</p><p>Glass had served for many years in the United States Senate, representing his home state of Virginia. On the advice of his friends and allies such as Harry Byrd, Glass decided to jump into the Presidential race in 1932 as a favorite son, hoping to influence the Democratic nominee.

Despite some Congressional trouble in 1938, he was still widely popular, and the Republican Party was divided. However, Roosevelt had chosen to retire at the height of his popularity, largely in part due to a consensus on his successor - Mr. Cordell Hull. Hull had been Roosevelt's Vice President, and a key ally on foreign policy concerns - some called him the "Secretary of Secretary of State" owing to the degree of influence he held at the State Department. Roosevelt both trusted Hull and believed he could win the election, and so chose to forgo a third run.</p><p>The Republicans, meanwhile, reeling from their losses in 1932, 1934, and 1936, choose instead to make the election about foreign policy with the nomination of Robert Taft, a committed isolationist, after a long struggle at the Republican National Convention. With a growing number of internationalist Republicans, many felt slighted after Taft's nomination and instead choose to walk out of the convention.</p><p>As expected, the main issue of the day was international relations - a key topic was World War II had broken out the year prior. While Mr. Taft had flipped the Rockies, alongside Wisconsin, Indiana, and his home state of Ohio, even a gain of 82 electoral votes from Mr. Landon's margin was not enough to prevent Vice President Hull from winning and becoming the 33rd President of the United States.</p>`)

The renomination of Roosevelt, according to some, appeared doubtful...</p><p>...and then, suddenly, he died.

Amid chants of “Cactus Jack!” and cries for unity, the delegates turned to Garner as the man who can bring order to a nation spiraling deeper into despair.</p><p>Garner’s nomination is no surprise to political insiders. With the nation’s economy still mired in collapse following Herbert Hoover’s controversial second term, the Democrats have sought refuge in a candidate who promises stability over experimentation, restraint over radicalism. Garner’s campaign has centered on a promise to restore the rule of law and hold the line against what he calls the “rabble-rousers” and “reckless dreamers” pushing the country toward upheaval.</p><p>“The American people are tired of slogans and revolts,” Garner declared in his acceptance speech. “They want leadership that is rooted in common sense—not crackpot schemes cooked up by men who’ve never walked a cotton field or balanced a ledger.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Governor Floyd B. Olson of Minnesota has hinted at a Union Party ticket that would unite disaffected workers, farmers, and radicals under one banner. Speaking from St. Paul, Olson publicly floated the possibility of teaming up with Louisiana’s Huey Long, the flamboyant “Kingfish” whose Share Our Wealth movement has swept through the South. </p><p>Olson, with his Midwest farmer-labor base, and Long, with his Southern populism represent a coalition that threatens to upend the traditional two-party balance. Union organizers and unemployed workers have rallied behind Olson’s cry for massive public works programs and wealth redistribution, while Long’s call to “make every man a king” has electrified crowds from Baton Rouge to Chicago.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Republican Party, battered by Hoover’s horrifically unpopular presidency, has struggled to present a genuinely enticing alternative. The party’s likely nominee, Senator Arthur Vandenberg of Michigan, has found lackluster support, with Gallup placing him at 18% in a three-way race. This puts him behind a potential Olson candidacy at 25%, and leagues behind Garner, who leads the pack at 40%.</p><p>The country is seemingly tired of the whole ordeal. While the election continues, breadlines still stretch down city streets, and the specter of foreclosure haunts the countryside. Strikes and factory sit-ins have become commonplace, as workers demand fair wages and better conditions. In urban centers, Communist Party marches clash with police, while rural towns see the rise of vigilante groups determined to protect what little they have left.</p><p>Therefore, the question on every lip is not just who will lead the nation, but what kind of nation will be left to lead.</p>`)

Senator Bennett Champ Clark of Missouri has been nominated for President of the United States, emerging as the standard-bearer of a platform centered on “sensible isolationism.” Clark, a staunch critic of foreign entanglements and a key architect of the Neutrality Acts, has vowed to steer America clear of the growing storm in Europe while focusing on economic recovery and national unity.</p><p>Bennett Champ Clark has built his campaign on two pillars: a firm commitment to keeping the United States out of foreign wars and a pledge to restore economic stability at home. “America’s destiny lies within her own borders,” Clark declared in his acceptance speech. “We cannot afford to be drawn into the chaos of Europe’s quarrels. Our priority must be the well-being of the American farmer, the American worker, and the American family.”</p><p>Clark’s nomination has electrified his base and positioned the Democratic Party as the clear frontrunner in the upcoming general election.
