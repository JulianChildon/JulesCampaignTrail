That is the hope of Senator Frank Church of Idaho, a staunch progressive leader that narrowly snatched the Democratic Nomination from underneath Jerry Brown. Vice President Spiro Agnew hopes to continue the legacy of a moderate administration, burdened by claims of tax fraud and indulgence of kickbacks while governor of Maryland. His boss has not been without scandal either, Agnew will have to defer concerns of corruption and wire-tapping from Nixon's cronies. But with the Vietnam War soundly over, the candidates will debate amnesty, the ERA, the federal bail-out of New York City, busing and the continuation of DÃ©tente.</p>",

He used his influence to dissuade Maryland lobbyists from talking; the press thus never got wind of his behaviour and he never resigned. In 1974, H.R. Haldeman took full responsibility for the White House's involvement in the write tapping of the Watergate hotel. He was convicted by a grand jury and testified under oath that he acted alone. The now infamous Nixon tapes avoided subpoena allowing him to dodge impeachment and resignation.<br><br><img src='https://cdn.britannica.com/21/181121-004-32ED6E25/Frank-Church-Pres-Jimmy-Carter-White-House-1977.jpg?s=1500x700&q=85' width='120px'></img><br><br>Church performed well in the 1976 primaries as a result of his overwhelming opposition to Haldeman's conduct and his claim that Nixon was involved. He then procured help from progressive allies, Arizona Representative Mo Udall and Georgia Governor Jimmy Carter, to go onto to secure victory.</p><h4 style='margin-top: 0.5em;'>Credits: Joeyo 19: Creator, playtester, writer, coder</h4>",

But reform is not enough. Change is not enough. Nothing, you know better than most, is ever enough. It's time for America to transform it's deepest desire into an election, a mandate - better: a referendum. Frank Church can, must, will lead America into it's third century and here's why:</p><p>Nixon is a crook. He loves to deny it, but you know the truth. You know he's guilty of mass slaughter, fraud and god knows what else. He avoided impeachment and resignation thanks to his buddies. It's time for the people to serve a judge, jury and executioner. And it's not just him: Haldeman, Mitchell, Dean, Felt and Holmes. Agnew is your opponent, but he is not your enemy; you know you'll win, what really matters is achieving absolute victory. Sweeping the House and Senate, the only path forward to tear down the intelligence bureaus, fight the Military industrial complex and most importantly: Shut. It. Down. Wake up, Frank, it's time to go to war.</p>",
