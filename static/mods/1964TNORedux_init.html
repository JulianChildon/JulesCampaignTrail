Johnson rose as a Democratic leader after a controversial Senate victory in 1948, and now has the task of keeping the Republican-Democratic Coalition united against segregationist George Wallace, who trails massively in the polls outside of the South. Johnson ran a failed campaign for President in 1960 and seemed equally doomed against the insurmountable lead of President Kennedy in 1964, but triumphed at the convention after Kennedy’s assassination.

It was closer than expected, though, and we mean <i>much</i> closer. While Democrats still hold a plurality in the Senate, the Nationalists have trounced Republicans in statewide races to secure an NPP majority. You will almost certainly have to temper your expectations of what you can realistically get passed, but you’re no stranger to compromise.<p><p>Of course, your first order of business is the war in South Africa, which remains popular but loses more support with every plastic-wrapped corpse sent home.

Every major city in the country has erupted into flames, with enraged Black youths throwing Molotov cocktails in Chicago and exuberant Klansmen prowling the streets of Birmingham. You can almost smell the smoke wafting into your Johnson City ranch.<p><p>How did this happen? Your first instinct is to blame Dick--that goddamned crook couldn’t cover up a crime to save his life. But then it’s that shitass Bobby, who should’ve campaigned harder for you; then those idiot campaign advisors who bungled every appearance you made; the moronic union men who couldn’t see that voting Wallace was against their own interests; even Jack for pissing away his time in office.<p><p>Wallace will almost certainly move immediately to repeal the Civil Rights Act, killing perhaps the only law you passed that you really, truly loved. All the rest was nothing compared to the real prize.<p><p>You yawn. It’s late and the stars are shining. Tomorrow the real work of stopping George Wallace will begin; for now, you sit back in your rocking chair and light a cigarette. Luci looks out from the window, but she doesn’t stop you.
