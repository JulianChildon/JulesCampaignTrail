The Three-Body Problem in Lithuanian Politics'</a></strong></p><h4>Where are they now?</h4><p>So what is the historical result? Who actually won, and what happened to all the characters you can play as?<br><br><strong>The election:</strong> An intense race that started as a seemingly inevitable TS-LKD victory and ended up a nail-biter due to LVŽS recovering in the polls. Still, it was won by the <strong>'Right'</strong>. A coalition of TS-LKD, LRLS and Freedom (so Conservatives and Liberals) was formed and remains the incumbent government.<br><br><strong>The Šimonytė Cabinet:</strong> Immediately after the election, quarantine was imposed, causing wide controversy. Same-sex partnership law was proposed in the Seimas several times, but has (as of time of writing, September 2023) failed every single time due to opposition from TS-LKD's 'Christian Democrat' wing. The same happened to attempts to decriminalize marijuana. As a result, tensions between TS-LKD and Freedom have mounted and internal conflicts happen almost daily.<br><br>The government's pro-LGBT stance was answered by the formation of a wide anti-LGBT, anti-vaccination and anti-'Right' movement, the Lithuanian Family Movement, which organizes protests and has splintered into several political parties.<br><br><strong>Gabrielius Landsbergis:</strong> After the election, he was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs. Under his leadership, Lithuania challenged China over the Taiwan question, leading to a conflict that became international news, and it also became a vanguard of pro-Ukrainian policy in NATO during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. However, his popularity has plummeted and it is believed that he intends to resign from his party's leadership sometime before or after 2024.<br><br><strong>Ramūnas Karbauskis:</strong> After losing the election, he resigned from his parliamentary seat in protest, turned sharply towards anti-LGBT rhetoric and pulled out of the National Agreement on Defense in 2022. His party split - Saulius Skvernelis left in 2021 and established the 'Union of Democrats', a party which intends to be a more moderate continuation of LVŽS' 'statist' economic policy.<br><br><strong>Gintautas Paluckas:</strong> After losing the election, he resigned as chairman in early 2021. A leadership race took place between Juozas Olekas, the candidate of the conservative wing, and Vilija Blinkevičiūtė - the latter won, and she is the incumbent chairman. She retained some of Paluckas' reform (Gudžinskas is one of her vice-chairpeople), but is considered more in the party centre. Under her leadership, thanks to her personal popularity, the party regained its popularity and is now first in the polls. It is widely believed that the Social Democrats will win the 2024 election.<br><br><strong>Plaque of Jonas Noreika:</strong> It's still there.<br><br><strong>Statue to Petras Cvirka:</strong> Removed in 2021.<br><br><strong>The electoral threshold:</strong> The LVŽS attempted to lower it to 3% and received a presidential veto. They failed to overturn the veto by one vote. It is currently still at 5%.<br><br><strong>The National Development Bank:</strong> More or less forgotten, even by the LVŽS itself, even though it was their big agenda in 2020.<br><br><strong>Non-Lithuanian letters in documents:</strong> The language war was finally finished by the Šimonytė Cabinet. Non-Lithuanian letters in documents have been legalized and society has basically forgotten the question, it is no longer on the agenda.</p><br><br>\", \"has_visits\": 0, \"no_electoral_majority_image\": \"/static/images/2012-no-majority.jpg\"}}]");

Destroying the prestige of the Skvernelis Cabinet could make runoffs against the LVŽS favorable, if we expect to fight them in most constituencies. Going too liberal could lose us a lot of votes, as we would simply eat into the Liberal parties while losing support beyond our fortress - but if we go too conservative, liberal voters will be much less likely to support us as well.

Vilnius. Since 2007, it has had a cooperation agreement with the Russian Union and has established itself as a party representing Lithuania’s Slavic minorities. At times, it cooperates with left-wing governments, and it currently sits in the Skvernelis Cabinet as partners of the LVŽS. For years, it has unsuccessfully tried to ban abortion in Lithuania.<br><br>In the Southeast, the LLRA-KŠS has absolute control and cannot be assailed. It is an affiliate of Poland’s Law and Justice (PiS), but differs in that it is geopolitically pragmatic and is apologist of Putin’s and Lukashenko’s dictatorships. Because of this, they are despised by the Conservatives and Liberals, and their presence in the Skvernelis Cabinet is a headache for the LVŽS.<br><button onclick='back0()'>Back</button></p></span><span id='screen2' style='display: none;'><li><b>Name: Social Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania (LSDDP)</b></li><p>The Social Democratic Labour Party was established in 2018, after members of the LSDP who wished to remain in the Skvernelis Cabinet split from their party following its departure from the coalition. The LSDDP drew much of the party’s old guard and the majority of its parliamentary delegation, but little grassroots support - so, it quickly declined, conceding traditional left-wing voters to the opposition Social Democrats.<br><br>They remain loyal allies of the LVŽS, but the 2020 election campaign leaves the party uncertain of its future. It has also become a home for renegades from the Labour Party, most notably Jonas Pinskus, which has pushed the party to a more socially conservative direction - which may leave them completely overshadowed by the Peasants.<br><button onclick='back0()'>Back</button></p></span><span id='screen3' style='display: none;'><li><b>Name: Centre Party - Nationalists (CP-Taut.)</b></li><p>The Centre Party arose from a split in the Centre Union (which merged into the Liberals) in 2003 by more nationalist minded members of the party. It remained minor until 2016, when it was joined by Naglis Puteikis - former member of the TS-LKD who split in 2014 and ran for President on a populist anti-corruption and soft eurosceptic platform. Puteikis was immediately elected as the party’s chairman.<br><br>In July 2020, it merged with the Lithuanian Nationalist Union and changed its name. It reached a respectable performance with 6% of the vote in 2016 thanks to Puteikis’ name recognition, but his star has faded since.

It is against LGBT rights, immigration and European institution interference in national policy, and it deliberately positions itself against the TS-LKD, which it claims no longer represents conservatism.<br><br>The NS stands out from its right-wing contemporaries by being urban-focused - its voters lean younger than LVŽS and much of its leadership are philosophers and right-wing intellectuals. In this, it can be compared to the early years of the Alternative for Germany, both in leadership and in its opposition to the centre-right.

Of the three, the most prominent was Order and Justice - a personalist political party originally founded by President Rolandas Paksas, and led by Žemaitaitis until 2020.<br><br>It is economically liberal and supports some socially liberal measures such as a compromise option on same-sex partnerships, but generally aligns itself with the conservative electorate.
