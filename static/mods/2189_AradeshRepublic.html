And yet, you lost to Mayor Killian Darkwater.</p><p>The jury is still out on why the election ended up this way. Some say that that the polls heavily overestimated how many people would actually come out to vote for you. Others claim that Darkwater’s agenda was more in touch with the voters’s concerns, mainly on the economy, safety and the mutant question. Others still point to how you dealt with the Brotherhood of Steel, claiming that your foreign policy failures led to your loss. Whatever the case, it is certain to everyone that this was your election to lose.</p><p>President Darkwater will go on to block the Junktown-Shady merger and pursue an agenda of cracking down on crime, which includes expansive gun control, significant police funding and harsh penalties for lawbreakers, albeit with a dedication to due process and correct procedure.</p><p>As for you, you will serve as an influential but humble congressman for the rest of your career. You will never seriously contest the presidency ever again, but your daughter Tandi is set to continue your legacy.

Did he simply bribe and lie his way into power? <i>Was the New California Republic even ready for democracy in the first place?</i></p><p>Whatever happened, one thing is for certain – this is Water Merchant country now. The wasteland’s nascent democracy is being hijacked by monied interests as we speak. President Hightower claims to be a libertarian, and indeed, he will oppose certain policies like bans on open carry of firearms for example, but when big business grows stronger each day under his pro-business administration, how long will it take until the Water Merchants seize all control of the NCR? How long will it take until the political corruption under him will silence the voice of the people?</p><p>As for you, you will become an influential, but humble congressman.

It took ages to get a prohibition bill passed, the tobacco ban had to be taken out of the final draft, and when you finally signed it, the people were furious.</p><p>It only went downhill from there. Your administration completely underestimated both the supply and the demand for all of the now illicit substances. Seth had to mobilize the NCR Rangers to bust dealers and bootleggers, and even they were stuck in a game of whack-a-mole. With a motion of no confidence looming over your presidency, you were forced to re-legalize alcohol and cannabis. With the New California Republic still flooded with drugs, Tandi will pursue a compassionate approach to substance abuse, which will prove at least moderately more effective.</p>

                <p>The New California Republic did not hear much from the Vault Dweller. If the rumors are true, then they are still alive, but the Rangers have not been successful in search for them. You abandoned your attempt at contacting them in your time, but then something else caught your interest – their place of origin, Vault 13.</p><p>Your curiosity devolved into an obsession. You sent an expedition after expedition in hopes of locating the Vault, but each and every one of them came up with nothing. Eventually, in year 2196, you could not take it any longer, and with First Ranger Seth you would leave the NCR town, to personally track down Vault 13. Days turned into weeks, but neither of you were seen again. With your presumed death, Tandi has officially become the president of the New California Republic.</p>
