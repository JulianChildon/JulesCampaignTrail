You will be the first president since Grover Cleveland to serve non-consecutive terms. The word on the street is that Jimmy Carter was just way too unpopular to be President again, even though the economy and national environment seemed to be in his favor.<p><p>As for you, you have a long road ahead the next four years. There are many foreign policy challenges you are likely to face in the Middle East, but you were popular on that front when you were President the first time. You do have Congress behind you, therefore you can pass most of the legislation you are hoping to pass. Just be mindful of your slightly advanced age, but you are only serving one term. If all goes well for you, you can pass the torch to your running-mate or one of your sons in 2004. Best of luck to you, you will need it. </p>",

This is the fifth landslide for your party in 30 years, and Jimmy Carter has been the victim twice.<p><p>You will be the first president to serve non-consecutively since Grover Cleveland, and considering how strongly you won, you have majorities in both chambers of Congress allowing you to pass as much legislation as you want.

You did a tank photo op like Dukakis, BUT THEN you accidentally fired the tank and you hit a group of spectators. Killing 5. Your court date is in a month so you better start prepping a defense team.\" \"co-\" \"If you’re asking me for a pardon, you can shove it. Then in your speech to the nation about it, you claimed the ghost of Richard Nixon had fired the tank by controlling your body. You then spent $50,000 of taxpayer money on hiring an exorcist to try and remove him. That’s why you lost the primary, Al.
