It'll take awhile for them to recover their political power.</p><p>In the meantime, you have a lot on your agenda that you can pursue. Your five missions - economic growth, clean energy, NHS reform, safer streets, and economic opportunities should all be primary focuses for you. If you can pull Britain's economy back up, who knows how long you could be in office? Just don't stay too long - after all, look what happened to Tony Blair's reputation.</p>",

In any case, just like 2010, it's highly unlikely the LibDems will prop up a failing, sitting government, so be prepared to have Ed Davey as Deputy Prime Minister.</p><p>Of course, if the margin is close enough, you could also form agreements with the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland - depending on how many seats they got. Regardless, the math is in your favor, and you'll be called upon first to form His Majesty's Government. If you can pull Britain's economy back up, who knows how long you could be in office?

Rishi Sunak will be retained as Prime Minister, and will likely go down in the history books as one of the greatest Conservative leaders.
