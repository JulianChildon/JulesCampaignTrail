In 2021, she (controversially, having no law background) became Minister of Justice and Security, entering the forefront of VVD leadership, and started to be recognized as a possible successor to Mark Rutte.</p><p>Although Yeşilgöz-Zegerius is, like most prominent VVDers on the national level, a trusted associate of Mark Rutte, her law and order credentials put her on the right wing of the party.</p>";

A mysterious lavender bomb exploded across the country, enveloping the air with the soothing yet overpowering scent of lavender. As a result, a large part of the population seems to have been brainwashed into casting their votes for the so-called 'Forum for Democracy', which previously had only five seats in parliament.</p><p>The incident occurred just as polling stations opened their doors early in the morning. Witnesses reported seeing a series of small, drone-like devices dispersing a purple mist over major cities, including Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and The Hague. Within minutes, the lavender scent permeated every corner of the country, affecting both urban and rural areas. Reports from polling stations indicate that voters, under the influence of this aromatic phenomenon, exhibited a marked change in behavior. Many described feeling an overwhelming sense of peace and a strong compulsion to vote for FvD, a radically right-wing populist party which had only won an election once before and since then seemed stable yet small.</p><p>FvD-leader Thierry Baudet denied any involvement in the incident, attributing the unexpected victory to the party's "natural appeal and alignment with the public's desire to reject the tyranny of the party cartel."`]

There is also the issue that they will need to get other parties on board with your purple agenda, which is only going to make the compromises even more watery.
