                  <p>It was inevitable that such an unprecedented term could have such an unprecedented end. For the first time since 1824, no candidate has gotten a majority of votes in the Electoral College, throwing the results to the Congress. Luckily, you've long built relationships with many of the members there—Barbara Jordan, Tom Foley, and Carl Roberts—who you will be able to call on to prevail in that most sacred contest. But for now, you address your supports and tell them that the fight is not yet over. The assembled believers are awed by your speech, rendered silent by your eloquence. They shake their heads in wonder and look at one another with fearful awe. Your muttering even stuns Beau who gasps and holds his hand over his mouth to stop himself from speaking.<br><br>Only one person seems to resist the spectacle of the night and that's Pat, who keeps trying to push you off stage. It's outrageous, you realize, her attempt to hog the limelight for herself, but you always thought she was a bit of a glory hound. You'll have to remember to keep her far away when you negotiate with the House for your place in the Oval Office. After all, the work is not done. You and your A-Team still need to remake the world. You and Beau need to go down in history. No one should forget what you accomplished here tonight.</p>`)

                  <p>You're still here and that makes the loss all the more brutal. The map... a sea of red. It sears your eyes. It breaks your heart. Your whole mission... Your whole drive... It was to prevent something like this from happening. It was to stop.... Trump. Donald Trump who has... Project 2024. A dark vision. You can't go on. You bury your head in your hands while Kamala pats your back. You tell her you can't go out. You can't go on. All the faces are blurring together. The names are broken. You can't remember... It's okay Joe, she says, it'll be okay. I'll handle it. Just stay here. Just hold on, and then she goes out into the hall and you can hear her talking to Beau, no... Not Beau. It's.. Jake. Jake Sullivan. She's telling Jake that you can't go on and he says what do you mean are you trying to pull a Palin and her voice goes low and she says look at him Jake look at what you've done. I'm cleaning up your shit and you better fucking hope I do a good job. That shuts him up and...<br><br>Oh look, she's on television now... The crowds are... They... They're confused. She's thanking them for their support. She knows this result is... disappointing but the two of you will never stop fighting... Never stop. It's one of the best speeches, you think, even though the words slide out like dead letters and her face is... Warped. Maybe there's a future for her in this new America... if America survies at all. All you know is that when she comes back, she helps you up and gives you a tight hug before helping you out into the hallway and into your car and into the night.</p>`)

                  <p>The result isn't unexpected after the president's health crisis but still the loss is painful. Come January, you will have to turn over the keys of government to Donald J. Trump, a man that you once described as the greatest threat to America's democracy. Will the country's institutions hold? Will Biden’s legacy and your work survive the assault that Trump plans to inflict? Only time will tell, but hopefully you'll be ready to make a difference come 2028.</p>`)

                  <p>It was a hard-fought battle against the Establishment. They stacked the deck and rigged the game the best they could. It was inevitable that you would fall, but worry not. The Elites have made you a martyr. By striking you down, they have only motivated your dogged supporters to try harder, to push further. Autocrat though he may be, Bush's victory will soon turn to ash in his mouth. At least, this is what you say in your brilliant concession speech before the silent crowd. They are moved to silence by your words, shocked by your vigor and inteligibleness. You spot people in the crowd so moved that they begin to cry. Even the news reporters broadcasting your remarks are speechless. Their ashen faces and striken expresions betray their guilt at their betrayal.<br><br>Only one person seems to resist the magnificence of your speech and that's Pat, who keeps trying to push you off stage.
