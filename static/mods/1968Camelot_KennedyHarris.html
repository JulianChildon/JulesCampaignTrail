You let your head collapse into your palm as the final unimportant states are called, and you stumble into your kitchen, looking for the hardest beer you can find.<p>Your headache only worsens when you realize that despite the large majority the Democrats have in Congress, many of those congressmen are under Wallace's segregationist ideology, meaning that they are no-goes to work with. This means that you'll most likely have to work with Nixon if you want anything done. Harris, on the other hand, should be confirmed by the Senate pretty easily, so you have that to celebrate - it’s hollow, but something nonetheless.</p>`;
