You will have the House, but not the Senate: Republicans won there. There may be issues with the electoral count as a result, so you'd be wise to keep in touch with the military, should you need an assist in taking office.

Any Republican challenges will be <i>Swift-</i>ly defeated, and political violence should be limited to a few crazies in the face of such a resounding win. \n\nGet ready to push through your bold, progressive agenda, once you can.
