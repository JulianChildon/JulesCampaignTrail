Such wishes may seem unreachable, given the divisiveness of American politics, but she has a secret weapon up her sleeve: war. For pundits scratching their heads over how Haley could pull together such a hopelessly disparate country, take note of her inaugural speech. <br><br>When making reference to the Cold War “Twilight Struggle,” Haley went on:“Today, we find ourselves on uncertain ground. Locked in a struggle between the children of light and the children of darkness, between humanity and the law of the jungle. Rising powers in the East must be met with resolve, As Americans, we have seen our country unite against a common enemy before, and we are ready to do so again.”<br><br>If you’re looking for a Haley Doctrine, look no further. While her oblique references to the legacy of Donald Trump got more attention, her barely-concealed desire to unify the country in a war against Russia and China (to say nothing of Iran and North Korea) could be the defining policy of her presidency. Her domestic agenda are already facing headwinds in Congress, but on foreign affairs, she has enormous leeway. This is vital in a rapidly changing global landscape, where Russia and China’s dictators grow closer.<br><br>With Ukraine aid stalled, this could be the big break those in the Beltway have been waiting for. The Biden administration settled for “weakening” Russia, but the Haley administration won’t stop short of defeating it. Those naysayers fearing nuclear holocaust in a direct shooting war between Russia and the U.S. should have nothing to worry about. This conflict would be fought on actual Russian soil, the Ukrainians are irrelevant here. It is highly unlikely that Putin is suicidal enough to use nuclear weapons if he knows his regime faces an imminent existential threat.<br><br>Likewise, the few lone nuts in Congress voicing concern over Haley’s aggressive policies against malign Chinese influence in the Pacific have even less reason to worry. American foreign policy has created a free and open Pacific since the 1940’s. We’ve shown what it takes to blast away a few nasty regimes threatening our American lake, and what weapons we would need to do it. Besides that, there’s hardly any precedent for American wars turning into prolonged bloodbaths in East Asia.<br><br>All of this should be cause for celebration among those fretting that American power is in terminal decline. Diving headfirst into half a dozen major conflicts at once while ignoring domestic policies and declining economic standards are all signs of a healthy global hegemon.</p>"

What A Second Kennedy Presidency Means for Foreign Policy</h3><p><p style='margin-top:0em;'><br>atlanticcouncil.org<br><br>Mar. 21, 2025<br><br>Now two months into the first term of President Robert F. Kennedy Jr, his general posture and rhetoric is clearer, even if his policies aren’t. His stunning victory in the contingent election that decided the 2024 presidential race yielded wide ranging predictions of how he would govern. With what is essentially a coalition government, would he lean to the center? Would he seek support from Democrats by harkening to his family’s legacy? Or would he remain in the corner of the right, as his campaign had increasingly drifted over the course of the race?<br><br>These questions cannot be fully answered yet, although we can get a sense of Kennedy’s big ideas about the U.S. government. He wants it to be less visible, though not necessarily smaller, and thinks private enterprise should have a greater role in American society. These ideas are not altogether different from ones held by many Republican and conservative Democrats. For many, they are surely a sign of relief. Yet it is his foreign policy that remains most confounding to outside observers.<br><br>While campaigning on an end to “endless wars,” he was obviously tight-lipped about how specifically to wind down U.S. commitments in Ukraine and the Middle East, while being outright supportive of Israel’s bombardment of Gaza. A protest candidate running on nice-sounding buzzwords while sparingly invoking any concrete policy solutions is hardly unexpected, but once put in the hot seat of the commander-in-chief, it’s another matter entirely. It remains to see how President Kennedy approaches difficult challenges in the Pacific and across much of the Third World.<br><br>However, as part of his agreement with legislators that allowed him to seize power, Kennedy promised to remain quiet about continuing aid to Ukraine. As reported in <em>Politico</em> earlier this month, military aid still flows to the besieged Ukrainian military trying to gear up for another offensive this summer. While it is highly unlikely that Kennedy will pass a supplemental as large as those agreed to earlier in the war, members of Congress seem to agree he will generally let the issue stay as it is, not rocking the boat too much one way or another. Any proposed negotiated settlement remains far off.<br><br>With regard to Israel, his policies remain starkly similar to President Biden’s. Like his predecessor, Kennedy too has spoken at length about his deeply held support for the country. Yet as Israel faces a governmental, military, and institutional crisis on virtually every front, this steadfast support will be tested. Kennedy has been in favor of increasing the bombing of Gaza, to “get it over with.” On the northern front with Hezbollah, the chaotic transition has largely sidelined the State Department, leaving the U.S. diplomatic presence there alarmingly empty.<br><br>With these wars showing no sign of stopping, some may take cold comfort in Kennedy’s presidency essentially being more of the same, albeit with some strange rhetoric and oblique references to how his father was killed. Yet the total absence of U.S. diplomacy and quiet acquiescence about the usefulness of military might should concern us all. Similar alarming developments, combined with hot-headed rhetoric, is what drifted another Kennedy presidency into a catastrophe in South East Asia. Hopefully Kennedy will let cooler heads prevail.<br><br><em>Update: This article was written before President Kennedy’s recent landmark speech inveighing against a U.N. resolution proposing a permanent ceasefire in Gaza. Kennedy’s new plan to resettle displaced Palestinians to the Democratic Republic of the Congo was not factored into this article when originally published.</em></p>"

As conservatives, many of us recognized his utility in the presidential elections, but were skeptical of his policy platform. On energy and the war on woke, we may diverge, but all conservatives should support his strong push to end the invasion across our border.<br><br>President Biden’s weakness on this front has been nothing short of a catastrophe. Drugs, crimes, and rampant immorality have been pouring across our wide-open border, and not only were socialists too cowardly to stop it, they actively encouraged it. They and their sympathizers in the Republican Party, like RINO Nikki Haley, refused to take the action necessary to stop it. <br><br>For voters who had this as their top issue, RFK Jr. was the best candidate in the race. But campaign rhetoric is one thing, concrete solutions are another. Kennedy was right to think global early on. He consulted with numerous officials in countries that have had severe border issues in the past, learning what went wrong, and what they did to make things right. Kennedy’s trip to Tel Aviv this past month was reportedly the high watermark of private discussions that have raged for months between his allies and Israeli government officials.<br><br>In fact, when analyzing Kennedy’s border plan, there’s a lot here from what the Israelis have learned. Electronic fences, moats, and automated machine guns have secured Israel’s border for decades, and continue to do so today. Kennedy’s cribbing of their solutions here, especially the famous Iron Dome system, was smart thinking. While some from the liberal media have mocked this proposal, arguing that Mexicans do not fire rockets into US territory, the fact is that they always could. That is why our Iron Dome is proactive thinking, a kind which has been absent in Washington for years.<br><br>As much as the uniparty may declare this bill “dead on arrival”—and knowing how they operate, it probably will be—President Kennedy still has the power of the office at his command. His first few months have been rocky, no doubt, while he navigated the winding bureaucracy of official Washington. What made matters worse were their attempts to thwart him. His allusions to the men who killed his uncle being behind the murder of his bill to end the invasion was dead-on. <br><br>Kennedy’s warning to his critics was also well-put. They can either pass his bill through Congress and use whatever influence they may have to make adjustments to their liking, or they can kill it and watch President Kennedy sign a far more expansive executive order should this fail. It’s not only smart politics, it’s wise strategy.<br><br>Conservatives must support this bill and rally to our president. We’re stronger together.</p>"

Use Airpower.</h3><p><p style='margin-top:0em;'>aei.org<br>The American Interest<br>July 22, 2025<br><br>The ongoing Anti-Terrorist Operation (ATO) is making progress against stubborn resistance in over a dozen major cities. The terrorists are not necessarily armed, but they are growing increasingly difficult to spot among the population. Curfews and lockdowns are necessary, as is the recent supplemental passed to equip our troops with heavy armor. But it’s not enough.<br><br>If Washington is serious about winning this war—and it is a war—they need to start using the United States Air Force. A handful of drone strikes have only had the force of a pinprick. Decisive and overwhelming power is needed if the terrorists are to be defeated.<br> <br>We have tried mass detentions and targeted raids, but it is ineffective against an enemy of this scale. Some critics will say this approach would be counterproductive, given the fact that most of these insurgents do not even hold territory. If anything they are closest to a guerilla group, they would argue, maybe even less than that given their lack of coordination and general lack of interest in actual violence directed against our troops.<br><br>This is simply false. In Afghanistan and Iraq, the U.S. has demonstrated the effectiveness of airpower against entrenched insurgencies. Few would deny the success of those operations, and neither the Taliban nor al-Qaeda in Iraq held any significant territory. They too blended into crowds of civilians, and yet each group was successfully vanquished through aerial bombardment. <br><br>There is little reason to doubt such a strategy would fail in our own country, apart from the failure of political leadership. If President Nikki Haley does not have the willingness to use any means necessary to liberate our cities, then perhaps her emergency powers should be stripped away, and she be replaced with someone ready to do what is necessary. We are already rounding the corner, we just need one last push for total victory.<br><br>In the words of Madeleine Albright, “What's the point of having this superb military that you're always talking about if we can't use it?”<br></p>"

The Anti-Terrorist Operation (ATO) was not only a brave action, but a successful one. Despite hysterical warnings from the ACLU of the ATO “ending democracy,” it in fact strengthened our democratic institutions. The elections of 2024 continued apace, and those living in cities on lockdown were able to vote as they pleased. Scattered accusations of voter intimidation hardly hold up, considering Harris lost decisively to Nikki Haley.<br><br>Likewise, despite fears from conservatives of President Harris establishing a dictatorship, the peaceful transition of power—our most cherished democratic tradition—continued as planned. President Haley has agreed not to politicize the ATO, like some in her administration have called for. Additionally, following the initial “shock and awe” sweep-up, the operations in the first 20 major cities have been general successes. A few metro areas have been more resistant to pacification than others (as of this writing, small pockets of several cities remain under terrorist occupation) but largely, terrorist forces have been mopped up with little bloodshed.<br><br>Perhaps the most unexpected victory of the ATO has been the public’s general willingness to accept it. When first polled, most Americans had serious doubts about military occupations, and said they personally would oppose living under one. But when asked about the specific cities the military would operate in, there was broad support nationwide. 71% supported an occupation of Portland, 68% favored a permanent military presence in New York City, and even a bare majority (52%) said they would be open to airstrikes in California’s major cities, if necessary.<br><br>While the ATO has been repeatedly stressed as a limited operation that does not need to resort to drastic measures, it has still been subject to harsh criticism from international bodies. Other permanent members of the UN Security Council have expressed serious concern about the use of drones and so-called “secret prisons” or “blacksites,” yet appear reluctant to take action. The Countering Terrorism Act of 2024 banning large public demonstrations also remain controversial overseas, with many rogue states like China and Russia attacking supposed “authoritarianism” and “hypocrisy.” Yet these regimes fail to understand the sharp decline in terrorist incidents since their passage, and the threat these mobilizations posed to US national security.<br><br>In sum, the ATO has been a clear success. It has not brought about the end of democracy, it has not sparked a second civil war, and it has not created more terrorists than it has brought to justice. The hundreds of thousands of radicals detained in special military camps are not subject to overly harsh treatment, and organizations like Amnesty International will be be granted the ability to inspect such facilities under military supervision once the ATO is complete. Granted, overcrowding remains an issue, but these will be sorted out in time.<br><br>Americans have reason to thank our troops for securing a durable and lasting peace.</p>"

History, they argue, is all fine and good as a subject to study, but they find my frequent invocations of the 1960s and 1970s as “silly.” Having never known the terrors of Bill Ayers’s Weathermen, the Black Panthers, and the terrors of the the Baader-Meinhof gang, they like to roll their eyes when I suggest that we’re living through a repeat of those dismal years.<br><br>But the times seem to have caught up with my arguments. Things have gotten so out of control that even Presidentrix Kamala “Devi” Harris has been forced to admit to the radicalism of the Marxoid Left. With campuses consumed by anti-white, anti-Jewish flower children and tolerance terrorists running our cities into the ground, Devi Harris announced the start of a crackdown, a zero-tolerance policy for “disruptors.”<br><br>It’s not hard to see the parallels. In Harris, we have a latter-day Lyndon Johnson (or a weepy, limp-wristed Hubert Humphrey), finally acting after years of refusing to acknowledge the uncivil disobedience roiling our streets. In the activists themselves are echos of Fred Hampton, a Chicago Black Panther leader brought to justice by police, and Bernardine Dohrn, a Weather<em>woman</em> terrorist who once went topless as she raided a high school—determined to assault children in more ways than one.<br><br>The Days of Rage of the Sixties have become the Days of Rage of the 2020s. The “civil rights” communists have been replaced by BLM communists. The homosexuals have been replaced by the Alphabet Mafia. Vietnam has been replaced by Israel, spitting and all.<br><br>Of course, if history is anything to go by, Presidentrix “Devi” Harris is unlikely to be successful in her efforts. While the Marxoids have delighted in smashing windows, slashing tires, and trashing streets to protest supposed “injustices” in the Middle East, Harris, like Johnson, is determined to retaliate only with the lightest of slaps. <br><br>The occasional drone strike on a Chicago bookstore might be good enough agitprop for the DNC nomenklatura, but far more aggressive policies are needed to reclaim our streets. Indeed, the Ayers and Dohrn Left are more likely to be encouraged than dissuaded by the revelation that Presidentrix “Devi” Harris’s drone crews include self-described “trans” individuals.<br><br>If there’s one bright spot, it’s this: Hampton, Ayers, and Dorhn might have succeeded in their campaign of terror in the short run, but their age came to a quick end. They and the other flower children were marginalized by a succession of conservative officials who were actually willing to do what it took to restore order to America. <br><br>Soon enough, Devi Harris will join them in the dustbin of history, reduced to just another specter.</p>"

How could their prized candidate lose to someone as patently nonsensical as Haley? After all, wasn’t she the one whose advisors had mused about invading France? Such ideas were written off by most liberals as too absurd to entertain. Yet here we are, in the early days of the Haley administration, and with the Democratic Party reckoning with another heartbreaking loss, asking themselves the only real question: <br><br>“Where do we go from here?”<br><br>Fortunately for grief-stricken liberals, the path is quite straight-forward. But first, it is important to dispel some myths. To start, the conventional wisdom is that Harris simply lost because she was unable to detach herself from the unpopular incumbent administration. Many have drawn parallels with the elections of 1952, when Harry Truman chose not to run, but wound up dragging down the Democratic ticket anyway. Reasons for President Biden’s unpopularity commonly cited include his age, economic hardship earlier in his term, and spiraling wars abroad. <br><br>None of these are true.<br><br>Despite constant “polls” and “academic studies” conducted by “experts” reportedly proving these claims, the truth is entirely different. President Biden began his term by embracing his party’s progressive wing. There may have been an argument that this was a marriage of necessity in the 2020 election, when he had to unite the party’s many factions, but it is something else to govern that way. Rather than governing from the center while making nods to his left and right, President Biden veered hard to his left, with little to no achievements for centrists to take credit for.<br><br>His gargantuan COVID-19 relief bill triggered the worst inflation in decades, overheating the economy and permanently eroding his standing among ordinary Americans. His continual support for unions only worsened matters. By the time the summer of 2022 rolled around and Democrats barely were able to pass their enormously costly “Inflation Reduction Act,” it was clear the party was doomed, and nothing could help them recover. Regulatory warfare waged by crusaders like Lina Khan were only continuing to dig the party’s grave.<br><br>Now, Democrats will be forced to ask the hard questions, not just about the economy, but about social issues. Gun-grabbing, abortion-on-demand, and genital mutilation for children are fatally unpopular positions. It was frankly political suicide for the Democratic Party to attempt to court such fickle demographics with policies catering to their special interests, while invoking nothing short of class warfare against their donor base. When President Biden called for those who succeeded in life to “pay their fair share,” it may have spelled the end of his presidency.<br><br>If the Democratic Party wants to have any hope of a future, they must embrace a pro-family, pro-business, pro-America message. Labour’s recent success in the United Kingdom under Keir Starmer’s leadership show this is possible. Strict abortion limits, shielding children from adult concepts about gender and sexuality in schools, and promising no further legislation curtailing the Second Amendment would be a wise place to start. <br><br>Sincerely,<br><br>Third Way<br>New Democrat Network<br>Democrats for Haley<br>Clinton Foundation<br>Protect Our Children<br>Freedom Is a Privilege Organization<br>Democratic Majority for Judea and Samaria<br>Third Internationalists</p>"

This is not due to overextension, but a lack of willpower among American leaders. Every president since the end of the Cold War has at times shown weakness when confronting our enemies, failing to go through to the end.<br><br>Due to these weaknesses, the United States is now in a weaker position than it was at the start of this century. Yet despite cries of isolationism, the American conservative movement remains decisively, if inconsistently, an interventionist one. On China, Iran, and Latin America, the Republican Party—and smaller conservative parties—consistently outflank the Democrat Party in proposing military action. Only on countering Russian influence do they falter, but this should not signal too much alarm among Republican internationalists. With Ms. Harris picking up that fight in earnest, there is little reason to worry about it among our own peers.<br><br><em><u>Policy and Messaging Recommendations:</em></u><br><li>“Supporting Israel unequivocally is in America’s national interest, since we are a majority Christian nation. To stand against Israel is to stand against God.”</li><br><li>This is a point repeatedly stressed in many quarters on the online right, as interest in ‘Christian Nationalism’ increases. It is important to remind those adherents that supporting Greater Israel is consistent with those values.</li><br><li>It is also worth mentioning Israel’s shared values with American conservatives, such as a strong military, annexation of land, and harsh treatment of minorities.</li><br><li>Despite some minor entreaties by American conservatives to Palestinian Christians, the Israeli government has chosen to adapt first, including the incorporation of fun online memes about how Jesus is the son of God and has more in common with the Likud party than Palestinians seeking refuge from war.</li><br><br><li>“It is an inherent right of the United States to overthrow any government in the Western Hemisphere which strays from our free market orthodoxy, supports our enemies, or is woke and gay.”</li><br><li>On this point, the messaging is refreshingly straight-forward. The cutting edge of the American conservative movement has even outflanked some on the internationalist wing in proposing a full-scale of invasion of Mexico, as well as long-standing goals of overthrowing the governments of Venezuela, Cuba, and Nicaragua.</li><br><li>These advances should be a source of optimism for Republican internationalists, and must be strongly supported. It is worth emphasizing the long history of American intervention in Latin America, emphasizing our right to overthrow governments as a tradition, and part of our national heritage.</li><br><li>Examples to point to could include: President Nixon’s crushing of democracy in Chile (1970-1973); President Eisenhower’s approval of a CIA invasion of Cuba (1959-1961); the long-standing U.S. occupation of Haiti in the early 20th century.</li><br><li>It is particularly useful to emphasize the “Us vs. them” narrative. That we are an enlightened people spreading democracy to backwards nations, akin to a renewal of Manifest Destiny. This point is particularly effective with conservatives.</li><br><br><li>“China is meddling in our democracy, so their government must be overthrown”<li>Again, on this issue, the modern American conservative movement is far outpacing even some of their internationalist allies. This anti-China strain should be encouraged. Fears of abetting the rise of hate crimes inside the U.S. should be overruled.</li><br><li>For many conservatives, the past 10 years have been marked by a sense that they are losing control. Over women, their children, and society. It would be worthwhile to emphasize that China is making their kids woke and/or gay, and that the “based”(1) position is to call for further military intervention in the Pacific.</li><br><li>If real systemic issues in American society were all regarded as stemming from China, it would represent a win for the conservative movement. </li><br></p>"

For the first time in many years, foreign policy was not only a top issue in the previous presidential election, but actually inspired mass protests led by students. The American people clearly wanted to have a stronger voice in how the nation’s leaders determine U.S. foreign policy, yet were sharply split on how to do it. Increasing partisan divisions over American involvement in multiple hot wars abroad leaves no clear path forward. <br><br>Faced with these challenges, President Harris has more or less chosen to stick with her predecessor’s policies, with some rhetorical changes. Keen Beltway observers have already noticed White House statements on the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza have made more passing nods at the suffering of Palestinians. In speeches, Harris stresses that upholding human rights is as important as defending democracies around the world. Yet when it comes down to her decisions in office, the situation is muddier. <br><br>A landmark deal brokered between Secretary of State William Burns and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman represents the most significant achievement in Harris’s tenure so far. Yet the agreement faces staunch opposition in the Senate, particularly over the role of a Saudi nuclear program, and has polled dismally with the American public. Harris has urged Congress to approve the measure, claiming it’s “the only way” to stop Israel’s wars in Gaza and Lebanon, yet the outcome of those conflicts will likely be determined on the battlefields, not inside the U.S. Senate.<br><br>In Ukraine, the story is largely the same as when Biden left office. Aid has slowed to a crawl while the war is at a stalemate, despite some European leaders’ support for sending larger contingents of military advisors. Such a proposal has been dead on arrival in the U.S., and it would take a major reversal of fortune to change that.<br><br>For China hawks, Harris has been the subject of mockery, particularly over her already infamous visit to Japan last fall, when she <u>vomited</u>, told a Hiroshima survivor that her <u>“skin looks amazing,”</u> and laughed for an unbroken <u>2 minutes</u> in response to a question about the potential for a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. However, gaffes aside, Harris has largely continued President Biden’s policy of “de-riskifying” the Pacific, forging closer military alliances with countries like South Korea, the Philippines, and yes, even Japan.<br><br>If Harris wants to focus on human rights, her actions as president do not necessarily reflect such ambitions. A highly-publicized State Department report determining that Israel is responsible for the famine in Gaza did nothing to stop the latest <u>$6 billion sale of F-35 equipment</u> to the country. Neither did the CIA’s assessment that MBS had personally authorized what have been described as “mass executions” inside the kingdom. There is always a tension inherent in U.S. foreign policy, tugging between the practicalities of maintaining long-standing alliances with undemocratic partners, and living up to the nation’s ideals of freedom and democracy. Yet by inadvertently drawing attention to such contradictions, the next few years may end up sinking global perception of the United States to even lower depths.</p>"

But this isn’t enough.<br><br>While it remains necessary to protect our toilets from the spread of wokeness, few issues have been as alarming as the growing threat our libraries now pose to these same conservative traditions.<br><br>The pornography that vile scumbags like your local librarian are inserting in the children’s sections should appall every American. Our children should not be permitted to learn about post-grad concepts like “gender.” Not today, not ever.<br><br>So what can President Haley use to take down these woke monsters insisting on teaching our children pronouns before they even learn grammar? The U.S. military.<br><br>A combination of limited airstrikes, targeted sanctions, and inserting our special forces into each public library will compromise this crisis to a permanent end. No longer will Americans have to engage in socialist concepts like “reading.”<br><br>The occupation that follows would lead to a steady program of de-bookification, mass firings of librarians still committed to the old regime, and bringing in consultants from firms like McKinsey to structure these institutions based on free market values. This could be organized by an authority created by the Pentagon, perhaps a Conservative Protection Agency (CPA). Loaning materials would cost a small fee, approximately $20 per day for books without ads inserted between the pages, and $30 for a tier called Library+.<br><br>We have witnessed an alarming build-up of pornographic materials in these libraries, transported via book-mobiles. When lawmakers were briefed on less than a page of one of these books, titled “My Two Dads,” they were so appalled, that this shut down the United States Senate. There are 25,000 copies of this book currently housed in our libraries. If there is even a 1% chance that anyone can be exposed to concepts like “homosexuality” in these books, we must treat it as an absolute certainty.<br><br>Such an operation would be a cakewalk and lead to a robust Republican majority in elections to come. In other words, it’s just a slam dunk for Haley. It is in our vital interests to accomplish this mission.</p>"

This is not only a colossal failure of American global leadership, but an utterly avoidable one. Politics are more fickle and divisive than ever, yet uniting to stop this menace in the Persian Gulf should hopefully be a bipartisan issue. <br><br>Fortunately, the Haley administration has put forward a robust strategy for the region, focusing on supporting Israel and out Sunni allies, while remaining steadfast against the growing Shiite threat. But bombing Yemen isn’t enough. Simply put, there is no way around the unavoidable fact that Iranian nuclear sites must be destroyed. A pinprick strike by Israel in April of last year had little effect. There is no substitute for American military might.<br><br>A shock and awe display of our power would have a reverberating effect, not only to Iranian proxies, but to their sponsors in Beijing and Moscow. On this front, there have been some promising signs. Haley’s decision to send another carrier group to the region was prudent, as is her acceleration of the Saudi-Israel normalization deal.<br><br>However, a larger cultural push is missing. The president has spent most of her term bickering with Congress and fussing over the intricacies of domestic policy. Is this really the resolve our country must show if we’re to confront the most fearsome threat in the Middle East in decades? Decidedly not.<br><br>However, there is a path forward. The success of pro-America, pro-military, anti-Iran media like <em>Top Gun: Maverick</em> show that the American people are ready for a fight. Haley must show the leadership of Pete “Maverick” Mitchell, who was able to unite a diverse team and put an end to their infighting. This can only be achieved through example. Haley must take charge and show the public what their commander-in-chief is capable of. <br><br>And that’s just miracle number one.</p>"

Let us also be united against defeat. Because let us understand: North Vietnam cannot defeat or humiliate the United States. Only Americans can do that.”<br><br>These words were delivered 55 years ago this November by President Richard Milhous Nixon, the slayer of the liberal order.<br><br>The parallels between the chaos confronting the country when Nixon took office and today are impossible to ignore. Inflation remaining high due to Democrat wars and the liberal welfare state. Woke activists imposing their radical views on race and sexuality down Americans’ throats. A dangerous world with raging conflicts overseas.<br><br>Richard Nixon did not cower from these challenges are cave to the Marxist left. He took on the terrorists and communist-sympathizers head-on. Through programs like COINTELPRO spearheaded by traditional American men unafraid of embracing masculinity, like FBI DIrector J. Edgar Hoover, effectively brought the Weather Underground to its knees.<br><br>In Vietnam, Nixon brought peace through strength. While refusing to give in to the demands of the vocal minority calling for an unequivocal defeat, Nixon continued to protect American troops in South Vietnam—and CIA operatives in Laos, servicemen in Cambodia, and airmen bombarding North Vietnam’s industrial base—and when he left office with grace, Saigon was strong. South Vietnam was free. And American troops were coming home.<br><br>The deep state could no longer tolerate this.<br><br>While we are told a fairy tale of Watergate, castigating President Nixon for his “corruption” and “election interference,” while holding the Democrats, the media, and their saintly Kennedys up as heroes. But as Strauss teaches us, there is always a hidden meaning. <br><br>In Watergate, we can also see the story of a conservative president on the cusp of bringing an end to the deep state after achieving a historic landslide victory. In their rage at their own defeat, the deep state then lashed out, smearing him in the press and delegitimizing his presidency. He left office with honor, despite their attempts to sully his name.<br><br>Today, conservatives must follow in Richard Nixon’s footsteps. This must not be a passing fad. As illustrated in a compelling discussion from 2017 between my friend Jeff Bell and fellow Manhattan Institute trustee William Kristol, what the right needs is a permanent revolution. Before we carry our project and plant our flag around the world, we must first seek regime change at home.<br><br>Now, more than ever.</p>"
