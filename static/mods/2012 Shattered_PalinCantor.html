            Don’t listen to the naysayers. So what if it’s a “technicality”? That’s their fault. It’s obvious that President Clinton underestimated you. Even after the walloping in 2010, she paraded around the country like she’d already won the election, while you snuck in the inside lane and snatched the belt for yourself.
            It must sting a little, though, knowing that for the next four years they’ll parade this pyrrhic victory over your head. With the Senate out of your hands and a divisive House majority, legislating will be a nightmare. But hell, it’s nothing a bit of elbow grease can’t fix. You’re a hands-on woman, and you’ll be a hands-on President. And then there’s always 2016. You can really prove you’re up to the task and finally earn some real respect.            </p>

                Wow! What else is there to say, Governor—pardon me, President-elect. The Republicans faced certain headwinds going into this election: the economy, Libya, and, of course, the reliable President Clinton. But this is bigger than that—you’ve tapped into something much greater. For a victory this astonishing, you’ve embodied the moment, plucked from obscurity to deliver this epic rout against the malevolent forces of liberalism. It’s... biblical. Just look at the television: Republicans have gained across the country, expanding their majority in the House and recapturing the Senate. It’s unbelievable. Four years ago, you were a laughingstock, blamed for one of the biggest losses the party had faced in generations. And now? Maybe someone really is looking out for you.            </p>

There’s never been anything like it. Ten years ago, you were the mayor of a town with a population of less than 7,000. Today, you were just elected President of the United States.
            You didn’t think you could do it—but they did. The crowds turned out night after night to see you, to support you. All you had to do was tell them what they wanted to hear, and in return, they rewarded you. And it looks like your election will have coattails. The Senate will likely hang in the balance with a tie-breaking vote from your Vice President, but we’ll have to wait and see. For now, take a victory lap—you’ve earned it.            </p>

While there are still a lot of uncalled down-ballot races and Democrats look like they will keep hold of the Senate—ensuring a tough few years ahead when it comes to governing—that comes later.
            What about the here and now? What you’ve done is nothing short of remarkable: unseating a sitting President, a Clinton no less, despite the constant backbiting you’ve faced from the upper echelons of the Republican Party who doubted that you, the Governor of Alaska, could pull this off.

I didn’t even know this was possible, hold on let me Google it. – Yep says here that the House will vote for President and the Senate for the Vice President. That means .. I guess it means that, you won? Yep you won. Crap that means you’ll be moving in to the west wing, and need to assemble a cabinet and then be President for 4 years, who could have though huh, you ... President. So I suppose a congratulations are in order, so go ahead and crack open the champagne with all luck come January you’ll be working across the hall from Evan Bayh. This is, certainly unusual but I’m sure you’ll find some kind of accommodation, get to know one another because if you don’t it will probably be an uncomfortable 4 years.

            Commiserations, Governor. You fought hard, but it looks like it just wasn’t meant to be. You came close—closer than your detractors ever thought possible. But the hurdles you faced proved insurmountable against the Clinton machine and the entrenched liberal media opposition.
            Still, compared to four years ago, look how far you’ve come. The House majority is secure, and Clinton’s popularity is still in the tubes. Does anyone seriously think Romney or Christie could have done better? Nope. That’s all projection.

            Because this? It doesn’t mean anything. Elections are more down to luck anyway. There’s no use analyzing where you went wrong—how you not only failed to defeat a historically unpopular incumbent but also threw away the historic House gains of four years ago, practically handing back the Democrats their supermajority.
            But that’s not a big deal. You’ve still got big things ahead. More book deals, probably. TV is always an option. Beyond that—well, I’ll have to get back to you. The future of the party?
