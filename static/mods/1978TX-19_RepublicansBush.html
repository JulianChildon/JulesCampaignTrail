    <p>It just seemed like a constant onslaught of attacks. First it was in the primary election, with Reese and Hickox questioning your conservative loyalties and attacking your family and character. Then it was in the general election with Hance turning up his charm to a whole new level. You may have had the looks, but Hance knew his way around these parts.</p><p>You had a massive war chest, at least comparatively to Hance, but it didn't prove useful in the slightest. As Hance kept on speaking on more his history than actual policy, you seemed like a brainiac with all these numbers and percentages. The people of West Texas didn't want to hear that, or at least a large majority didn't want to. They wanted one of their own and despite your constant lifting of your upbringing in Midland, it seems like you just weren't the congressman they wanted.</p><p>While local party people commend you for the work you put into this district, it seems like they're moving on from you. Instead looking to celebrate alongside Loeffler, Paul, Tower, and Clements. Don't worry about all that however. This is just a setback, and maybe once you recalibrate you'll show them all wrong and be a real winner...</p>`)
