This election is held after the third term of the National Union government, which, alongside the LKDP, the Labour Party and the Regions Party, forms the 'For Lithuania in Lithuania' electoral alliance which has won all elections since 2012.

Mass protests have been held several times during this period, including protests against the restriction of abortion rights, reforms to the Constitutional Court of Lithuania, and expansions to the Law for the Protection of Minors. Recently, the European Union has issued a one million Euro fine to Lithuania in protest of the recent restrictions of civil liberties.</p><p>In this year's nailbiter election, the government is challenged by the Citizens' Alliance (Piliečių aljansas), a coalition of Christian democratic, liberal, and progressive parties led by Member of the Seimas Eligijus Masiulis, who...</p>`]

The anxieties and tensions inside the Right Coalition must have been greater than anyone thought. And with so many potential partners among the 'Left', few anticipated the Social Democrats to go to the completely opposite direction and select someone from the despised previous government. The Liberals themselves were not particularly initially enthusiastic to enter a Left government, but a lot of unexpected things can be done for the sake of power.</p><p>After Freedom's demands to bring someone more friendly to the liberals as Prime Minister, Dovilė Šakalienė was tapped for Prime Minister. The coalition program represents a moderated version of the Social Democratic program. Vows to increase the budget to GDP ratio via unmentioned reforms to the taxation system were included, as well as reforms to the pension system, a nationwide road fund, and continued support for Ukraine. Freedom has managed to squeeze out a point to 'find a solution for the same-sex partnership question' in the program. This might be the deal-breaker - the Social Democrats were already not excited with the libertarians moderating their ambitions, and Freedom is immensely hated by almost all Left voters and politicians. In the first few Seimas sessions, the coalition has already begun to crumble - can it even last a year?</p>`]

History is being made as we speak - never since 1992 has a party won a majority of the parliamentary seats, and such honor falls to the Left in both instances. The Prime Minister has opened negotiations with DSVL and independent deputies to build an even more invincible majority which won't be threatened by any parliamentary vetoes or individual defections.</p><p>The government program is a one-to-one replica of the Social Democratic election program, and is thus certainly ambitious. The first items on the agenda are a thorough taxation reform, implementing a progressive income tax system, and abolition of the second pillar of the pension system. In foreign affairs, they may attempt a reset of relations with China, but aid deliveries to Ukraine are expected to continue at the same pace. A few squabbles between competing wings within the party may take place, but there's no doubt that this government will last until 2028.</p>`]
