He is taking the wrong direction, has been since 2093, and is trying to be some deep soulful lyrical genius. if we wanted that we wld listen to drake or kendrick or some shit. not yeat. did he quit the perkies too? i know he quit some of the more hardcore stuff he used to use when making music, but i feel like him going cold turkey recently is a reason for the poor quality of adl.<p><p>i know im not the only one thinking or saying this too btw lol. there's a reason it went only to charting top 10, when it should've been a clear #1 since lyfestyle did it lol. ken went number 1 and stayed number 1 for weeks!!! if noah oliver smith cannot do it at this point in his career we need to be having some conversations ngl <p><p>i had a lot of high hope for a dangerous lyfe. but he just didn't deliver. some ppl will like it, i don't think i and a lot of other real og yeat fans ever will. i guess we will have to keep listening to our leak and grail playlists. The future is not looking bright and i think the era is over.<p><p>one final suggestion to yeat: get back on the drugs. you make better music that way.</p><p><span style="padding-left: 60px;"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/8xqz4xc.png" alt="Image" style="width: 5%;">optimal_party9022</span><br /><span style="padding-left: 60px;">go fuck yourself</p><p><span style="color: #ff4500;"><strong>Because you visited this community before</strong></span></p><ul><li style="text-decoration: underline; color: grey;">r/politics President Buttigieg signs Inflation & Tax Freedom Act into law, cutting corporate and income taxes </li><li style="text-decoration: underline; color: grey;">r/worldnews Israeli, American aircraft enforce no fly zone over Syria</li><li style="text-decoration: underline; color: grey;">r/WestSubEver y'all fwing that new osamason ?</li></ul></div>`;

If you asked a fan what they thought about him at the end of 2020, they'd call him a visionary. At the beginning, when @ MEH released? A fucking idiot, washed, baby.<br><br> And now? Well, the same. After aura farming for five years, with not one, but <u>two fakeout albums</u> to show for it, people are just done waiting for Carti. He might've changed the sound of the last 5 years with Whole Lotta Red, but the sound and the game itself is moving past him, and his arrest and likely multi-year trial (assuming they try and get him like they did Thugger) has just sunk his career entirely.<br><br>Maybe his label will raid his vault to hobble together an album, like Thugger's did with Business is Business. But, more likely than not, Carti won't give a shit until he's forced to, or at least till he has to raise more funds to get<u> Brain Steel to make the case disappear against him.</u> <br><br>Either way, the future looks bleak for fans of Jordan Carter. Maybe we can just content ourselves with Whole Lotta Red, for 5 more years?<br><br>Luckily though, he can count on the support of Donald Trump, tweeting from house arrest in Mar-a-lago 'in support of this wonderful young Black man… whose music was very, very popular, under me especially, who Got Out The Underground under me, or so I'm told'. <br><br></div>`;

Earlier this spring, as President Buttigieg was engaged in a <u>ferocious shutdown battle</u> that saw nearly the entire federal workforce furloughed for three months, the Virginia rapper was engaged in his own vicious battle with his 'opps'. As Opium affiliate Ken Carson took shots at what he derided as a "pawtucket white boy wit' no racks," who "better <u>go back to Rhonda</u>,"  in his fourth studio album <i>More Chaos</i>, the internet went <u>up in flames</u>, and it caught the attention of the world.<br><br>Now, months later after emerging victorious from his lyrical duel with his Atlanta-based opponent which saw such number-one hits like <i>jugg n peace</i>, where he taunted Ken Carson for lacking any "coffins" and lauded his having "so many coffin' you can call me booty-jugg", I recently sat down and talked with young Gunner, who is eager to move on and help support the most vulnerable in today's society: disabled youths.<br><br>Norris: Well, Nett, congratulations! Performing at the White House is a really big accomplishment. But, why? It's not a traditional venue, or crowd, in the slightest.<br><br>Nettspend: Yeah it is. You know, like, it's important. To support these kids. I know a lot of people, a lot of cool people, who are disabled. <br><br>Norris: Well, true, but the White House isn't a place one would expect to find you [chuckles].<br><br>Nettspend: Yeah. But like, the President, he cares about this stuff. About my friends. I mean, and it's like, what's the point of being a <i>BADASSF*CKINGKID</i> if you don't stand for something? A lot of my friends, still in school [shakes head]. They were hurt, when that one guy, he shut things down.<br><br>Norris: Do you think you know why, Nett?<br><br>Nettspend: To like, help the rich, because the President didn't want to extend these tax cuts for them, or something. And you know, it's sad. Because he cares, about people, about people like me and stuff. And that's why he forced the other guy to back off, to stop.<br><br>Norris: You really are a <i>BADASSF*CKINGKID</i>, Nett.</div>`;

You've just picked your kids up from The Game, and The Team did well! They won. To celebrate, you turn on the radio, and your entire family is blessed.<br><br>As you hear Nuking is Now Legal, Worldwide you begin to asphyxiate. The music is good. Too good. Then, you hear. <br><br>As you process the lyrical DaVinci at work, indulge in the greatness of I-I-I walk into Balenci, make 'em wipe me down, you cop a glance at the rearview mirror, and catch your kids beginning to frantically worm in their seats, blood pooling out of their eyes, smiling. Your wife (who's deaf) begins flipping her shit. She starts fucking screaming, screams that sound stupid (because she doesn't know how to scream right), but by that point, you're going limp. The music is so good, your brain is liquifying itself. <br><br>It's calling quits. Shows over. Bon voyage. This is as good of an ending as you'll get, it thinks.<br><br>This is how I'd wish that 43 year old Vance supporting freak would react to Joeyy, the type of guy who cried when he saw Trump just keel over and finally die at the debate. No. Instead, he'd just snicker and laugh at it. Like he does at everything foreign, not wrapped up in an American flag, crucified, and safely wrapped in plastic that'll keep for millions of years. Just imagine how he reacted, when he saw baby Buttigieg take his first steps. How he reacted when the DOW defied gravity, how the President has begun to swiftly vanquish all of America's ills with a calm, calculated stride.<br><br>Sadly, he can't fix everything. He cannot save Joeyy's career with a <i>Presidential Commission on the Existential & Important Art Career of Joeyy</i>. It's time to admit that Joeyy will not last forever, that fads and generations come and go. <br><br>Just as Pete is balding, his hairline slowly marching away to the rear, Joeyy's career is slowly fading away. He has not reproduced the masterpiece of Gout, captured the subtle beauty of Bored. He has already came into his own, he has already conquered his own known world, as Alexander did with the Greeks. <br><br>Perhaps, if he had stretched out his illustrious career longer, some might wonder, it might have been for the better.<br><br>Absolutely not. Just as our President launched himself from being mayor of a small town, struggling to change its flag, to being… well the President, Joeyy launched himself from wherever in Providence to a new DaVinci of the musical arts. Joeyy and Buttigieg's sudden and masterful rise is key to their own characters, their own development as geniuses.</div>`;

Announcing the surprise imminent release of their new collaborative tape on a stream in Spain, Kanye stated that the album would 'blow heads off, and I mean literally … I got DigitalNas, I got DJ Khaled, Marilyn Manson … and maybe Mike Dean, but he still weird on my kids, on who really runs the world.' Carti quickly followed up Ye's announcement with his own, posting a fit pic on his instagram with the caption 'CARTI YE WE RUN THIS SHIT'.<br><br>While no release date has been posted next, Adin Ross (who has recently become something of an official spokesman for both Carti and Kanye) and DJ Akademiks both said that people should keep an eye out on Trump Jr's twitter, before going on to play a snippet sampling President Trump's recent announcement that habeas corpus was suspended for Illegals.</div>`;

It's time for a review of the new <b>Yeat</b> and <b>Lil Uzi Vert</b> album, Pinklyfe.<br><br>Here we have the first full-length album from both Lil Uzi and Yeat, both no stranger to dropping in quick succession, and who have both come off of what were to many rather disappointing releases with Lyfestyle and Eternal Atake 2. <br><br>Now, from what I understand, this album is more or less a resurrection of a scrapped project the two started working on in late 2022, early 2023, with a fine paint of polish and a sort of new style from Yeat and Uzi. It has these bombastic synthetic arpeggios, these droning 808s, with a very (laughs) surprising amount of social and even political commentary on it.<br><br>And let me just stop right there. Yeat, and Uzi, putting out any song with any hint of their political inclinations is very absurd on the surface. For good reason! But, they manage to pull it off. In tracks like <i>Onion</i> or <i>Insane</i> they manage to loop in bars talking about how 'that cheeto so kranky he schmanky the economanky' (laughs), which I mean, okay guys.<br><br>It's at its core just a very fun, very silly, very absurd project. Those political bits, mixed in with the usual energetic and youthful flow from Uzi, and Yeat's druggy and at times spaced out chorus, make it something that I feel is well, well worth a listen.<br><br>Now, it's no 2093, or Eternal Atake, just let me put that out there. But it's still a good album.<br><br>I'll give it a uh… decent schmecent <b>strong 8.</b></div>`;
