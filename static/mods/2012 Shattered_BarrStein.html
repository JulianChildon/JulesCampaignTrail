            What a fabulous waste of time. When the Green Party made the decision to nominate you, it was a conscious attempt to set aside rigid ideological purity to expand their notoriety—to reach out to the great swath of pissed-off Americans who might just be willing to get behind a national celebrity. It’s a gamble that has clearly not paid off. Looking at the sheer scale of President Clinton’s re-election victory, it seems not many people were willing to register their discontent with this government, and maybe you played a role in that. Not a big one. It’s doubtful that the Republicans will nominate someone so obviously incompetent as Governor Palin next time, but neither will the Green Party be taking its chances with someone like you again. But hey, at least you seemed to have fun.

Critics praised <em>Citizen Barr</em> for its biting humor and raw portrayal of political disillusionment. When asked for her reaction, Barr wasn’t about to let it slide quietly: “Congrats to the whales, they swim and splash around—it’s really exciting. But I’m not going to be too sad to see them go the way of the dinosaurs.”

The award for Best Documentary Feature instead went to <em>Libya in Color</em>, a harrowing depiction of the Libyan Civil War. Critics praised <em>Citizen Barr</em> for its biting humor and raw portrayal of political disillusionment, but it just wasn’t enough in such a competitive category. Barr, however, was not tight-lipped after the loss, and host Seth MacFarlane couldn’t resist poking fun at her fiery reaction: “Some win, some lose—that’s showbiz, folks. And may I remind everyone that there’s a limit on dirty language *and* a limit on drinks.”

I guess this was all worth it.” Barr’s victory speech took a playful tone as she added, “It’s not the White House, but it sure is something!” Critics have since hailed <em>Citizen Barr</em> as a groundbreaking political documentary, giving viewers a raw, witty look inside the most recent presidential election. Michael Moore took the stage to add his own message: “This film is a warning to the President—people want more than do-nothing politics. They want real action.”

                <em>Roseanne</em> will officially take its final bow, with ABC renewing the show for a seventh and final season. The farewell season will consist of six episodes, reuniting the original cast—including Roseanne Barr, John Goodman, Laurie Metcalf, Sara Gilbert, and Lecy Goranson. The renewal was delayed due to scheduling conflicts, particularly with Goodman, but fans can now expect a proper goodbye to the Conners. ABC released an emotional promo blending scenes from the revival and the original series, with a voiceover declaring, “You’ve been part of this family for years.” The show recently celebrated its 150th episode, making <em>Roseanne</em> one of the few sitcoms to reach such milestones across two eras. The final season promises to wrap up the Conners' journey with laughs, tears, and a fitting send-off for Roseanne’s iconic matriarch. "Be there to say goodbye," the promo urges.

        It was a cold December morning when the news came through. In an unprecedented move, the Electoral College—an organization as archaic as it is complicated—threw a spanner into the works. The President had been narrowly re-elected, and the liberal media were busy trying to put your candidacy and your movement in the rearview mirror. Meanwhile, the Republicans and their Tea-Party cohort were already considering if they had any legal pathways to overturn these slim margins. And then came the shocking revelation: 
        <span>${electorText}</span> has thrown the entire election into chaos by casting their votes not for Hillary Clinton but for television comic-turned-Green Party candidate Roseanne Barr.<br><br>
        What comes next is anybody’s guess. The White House has yet to issue a response, but just picturing Clinton’s face right now, you can almost hear the screams. She’s likely busting an artery at the very least and is doubtless kicking the attorney general and every lawyer they can find to toss this out. And if this mess does hold, come January, the House will have to decide who becomes the next President. That means Palin is almost certain to take the oath. But for now? There’s a small but distinct possibility that you could become President of the United States. So… strap in.

The blame game starts quickly, of course, and as expected, you’re the first one the liberal press cites as the cause of the President’s defeat, desperate to lay the origin of this epic embarrassment on someone else’s doorstep. But beyond that short burst of anger, it doesn’t look like you’ve made the impact you hoped for in this election, and the Green Party isn’t exactly thrilled with the direction you took this campaign. But if there’s an upside, you’ve rediscovered your love of stand-up. Some of your next gigs are already selling a lot better. Maybe politics wasn’t your thing—no harm, no foul.

                Roseanne’s political future is in doubt, it seems. Despite rumors of a second presidential run, one that could threaten any Democratic challenger to President Palin in 2016, that has seemingly evaporated after accusations that her famed sharp tongue has alienated key factions of the Green Party base. The object of controversy? Her new Netflix stand-up special, <em>Simply Roseanne</em>. In the special, between her typical set railing against the state of politics, the two-party system, President Palin, and out-of-touch Democrats, Barr decided to touch on gender discourse in an attack on the President—remarks that some in the LGBTQ community described as transphobic. Things weren’t helped by Barr’s obstinate refusal to apologize, inviting her critics to “grow a fucking spine.”

In a recent interview on <em>VICE News Tonight</em>, Barr recalled returning home after the election and Palin’s inauguration. “It was all strange. I just kept thinking, ‘Is this my fault?’ I mean, I didn’t hand her the keys to the White House, but did I help? Maybe. But in my own defense, I didn’t know how bad it was going to be.” Barr’s campaign caught wind and even drew several Democrats in the aftermath of President Clinton’s defeat to cast their ballots for her as a form of protest. But Barr herself says she wasn’t entirely certain of the consequences of her campaign and was more focused on domestic troubles. “They say I wrecked everything, but I didn’t create this mess. And it wasn’t my job to fix it—I just pointed at it. Maybe too well?”

            It’s a long shot. But isn’t that what they said last time? And look what happened—all those Democrats, hand-selected by Hillary Clinton, decided to write your name into the congressional record over that of the President. Millions upon millions of votes cast for you—not just out of anger at the two terrible candidates, but because people genuinely wanted to. And you worked damn hard for it. 
            <br><br>
            Now the Democratic Party is staring down the barrel. Bernie—God bless him—he simply doesn’t have the juice for another campaign. Bayh is a hack job, worse than Clinton in every respect. And then who else is really out there? Are Americans really going to elect this 'Barrack'  fella ? He talks a big game, but what has he really done all these years? They’re all just spineless politicians afraid to really tell it like it is. 
            <br><br>
            You could run for the Green Party again and win that party’s nomination in a heartbeat—but re-runs are never quite as fun.

                For the first eight seasons, <em>Roseanne</em> was one of the most relatable series to ever be on television. The kids misbehaved, bills were paid late, and jobs were lost. But Season 9? That’s when everything went haywire. In a total departure from that gritty, grounded, barely-hanging-on ethos, Roseanne Conner decides to run for President. All of a sudden, this show about low wages and simple pleasures shifts gears into a political farce. Not only does Roseanne’s campaign gain traction, but somehow—in the pièce de résistance of '90s sitcom writing—she manages to defeat President Clinton and Elizabeth Dole in an upset for the ages. The Conners spend the next few episodes preparing for their trip to Washington.
                <br><br>
                Considering how far the show had gone off the rails, the finale serves as a frantic attempt to realign everything. Roseanne’s final monologue reveals that the events of the last season were entirely fictional. In reality, Roseanne is sitting on her couch, writing a book. Everything that happened was a figment of her imagination.
                <br><br>
                The series ends with her alone in an empty house. A quote from T.E. Lawrence appears on the screen:
            </p>
            <blockquote style="font-size: 14px; text-align: center; color: black;">
                <i>“Those who dream by night in the dusty recesses of their minds wake in the day to find that all was vanity; but the dreamers of the day are dangerous men, for they may act their dream with open eyes, to make it possible.”</i>
            </blockquote>
