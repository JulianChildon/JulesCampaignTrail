                Finally. It was about time that things started to go your way, and at last, they have. Given how close things were, it was always a distinct possibility that someone would lose the popular vote yet win the election. You just hadn’t expected it to be you. But hey, that’s the way the cookie crumbles, and there’s no point in us complaining about it—the Republicans will do that job for us. It’s hardly a nice feeling, though, after that runaway triumph four years ago, to win today on what is effectively a technicality. And you can be dead certain that the Tea Party Republicans aren’t going to forget this. They’re already crying fraud and searching for missing ballots. Perhaps now is the chance to eliminate the Electoral College altogether, but after everything you’ve been through, why bother?

You’re an icon, you’re indispensable, you’re Hillary Rodham Clinton. There’s a lot you could do: write books, tour the world, produce movies. Perhaps what will finally finish off this Tea Party is a taste of responsibility, so you can watch as it all falls apart. And then, should the country need its most experienced public servant to lay down her plough and return to Washington, you can accept their apology and walk back through those doors. Consider it an extended vacation—you’ve had one of those, haven’t you?

But it seems the Republicans made a historic error in selecting Sarah Palin as their candidate, and now you’ve won in what can only be called a landslide—rivaling, and in some parts of the country even surpassing, your 2008 victory. Democrats have recaptured the House of Representatives and will walk away with a bolstered Senate majority, almost certainly signaling the end for the Tea Party and paving the way for a full revival of your legislative agenda. What a stunning turnaround—congratulations! I’d wish you good luck, but it seems you don’t need it.

While it may not match your 2008 achievement, this is a substantial win given the circumstances. Of course, a few outstanding House races remain to determine control of Congress, but this result almost certainly signals the end for the Tea Party, allowing us to return to the bargaining table with moderate Republicans back at the helm.

There’s no need to be startled, and experts think there is a 99% chance this won’t hold. It looks like <span>${electorText}</span> has just cast their vote in the Electoral College for… Roseanne.

But again, we’re sure that this won’t happen—95% sure it won’t. Oh, did I say 99% before? Um… that’s what I meant.

It’s almost enough to make you laugh—if you weren’t already crying. A thought creeps in: perhaps you should concede and ask some electors to switch to Palin to avoid the final humiliation, or maybe it would be better to watch her flail and, in four years, who knows?
