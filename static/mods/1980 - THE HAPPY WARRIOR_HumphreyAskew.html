CONNALLY'S FLAWS NOT TOO BAD FOR AVERAGE VOTER?</h3><br><br>As you watch the final states get called from your hospital bed early the next morning, you can't help but feel strangely at peace with the result. While you had indeed failed to capitalize on Connally's many flaws, you also kept your campaign afloat to where it was really close in a lot of states. Perhaps you didn't bridge the gap well enough between your conservative and liberal beliefs, and alienated enough of one side to where they abstained to vote, or too many people were turned off by your stroke and health. Regardless of what happened during the campaign, nothing is more avoidable than the truth that you barely fumbled an October Surprise.<br><br>Connally gives a cautious victory speech in Dallas, touting that 'Humphrey's attempt to sic a federal investigation on him failed miserably.' even though this isn't true in the slightest. You can still take pride in the fact that there is still a major federal investigation hot on his tail. It seems that the Nixonian incumbency is here to stay for just a little longer. Democrat's down ballot have suffered a few losses, -- nothing major, but still worrying -- and they still hold majorities in both chambers.<br><br>And this is where you are left, an old and haggard senator, increasingly left adrift by the forces that be. You are likely to spend your last days in your senate seat, or the hospital. I'm sorry Hubert, but it wasn't meant to be it seems.",
