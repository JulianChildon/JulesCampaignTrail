Still falls short though.</h3><p>In a campaign saddled with a man as unpopular as you, combined with the Bush campaign hitting you hard, this is a complete shock. Everyone's expectations were thrown out of the window when they woke up on November 9th. Democratic operatives are baffled that you've done this well, as Democrats down ballot have held steady. However, you've still lost by quite a bit, but Levin is pleasantly surprised that you didn't embarrass him or yourself over the campaign.<p>Fret not though, as you are still a dedicated social activist and leader of the rainbow coalition. You will continue your work and use your name recognition to further the cause of good, and you've shown the resilience of your movement with your comeback aswell. - But in the meantime, be proud Mr. Jackson, for all you've done!",

You yourself cannot even believe it, as states are called for you, it becomes it apparent that you'll crack 270, your celebratory group bursts into cheers. Levin (not present at the party) gives you a completely dumbfounded call, expressing his apologies that he underestimated you, Bush calls later that night, and is obviously very tense, but he tries to make it work. You'll deal with him later.<br><br>What does this mean on Capitol Hill? Well, a few Democrats of your caliber were elected to the house, and congressional majorities were slightly increase, meaning that there is ample room for you to get what you want passed - as long as congress finds it acceptable. But once you become President, make sure to not forget who brought you to this office - the Rainbow Coalition.",

This is a crazy victory for you and your supporters, and your election night party is off the ropes ecstatic. You recieve a plethora of calls that night. Dukakis, Levin, Bush, hell even Reagan chimes in about your monumental win.<p>What will change on Capitol Hill? Tons. A new wave of \"Rainbow Representatives\" rode your coattails to victory, and with their help, you'll have a key allied delegation in the congress. The GOP is scratching their heads wondering how the hell they fumbled this. The most likely opponent in 92' will be Dole, however if you especially screw up, they could throw a curveball and nominate someone such as Buchanan or Gramm.
