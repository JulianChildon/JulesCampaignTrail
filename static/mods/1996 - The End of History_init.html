On August 19th, 1991, a coup d'état is pulled off in the Soviet Union, ousting not only Gorbachev but also Boris Yeltsin from power, quickly allowing the State Committee on the State of Emergency, or the GKChP to assemble some form of a functioning government.

Pretty quickly, some of the Soviet Republics - most notably Ukraine, declare the Soviet Government illegitimately in power, and begin to ignore orders from Moscow, as do parts of the military.

The Baltic States fight a long independence war, but many flee the country - and some don't look back.</p><br><p>The violent imagery from the Soviet Union are a perfect distraction for slightly worsening economic situations, and voters see George Bush's stable leadership as crucial in this bloody, dark, and final era of the Cold War.

In their official autopsy, Democrats blame a lack of a proper foreign policy platform, as that was voters' main concerns during much of the election.</p><h4>Special Thanks</h4><p>I want to thank everyone who playtested.
