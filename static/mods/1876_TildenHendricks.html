As corruption is a major issue in this election, how much do you want to tie this even into your campaign?"], [4012, "A major driver of Grant's economic boom was the construction of the Northern Pacific Railway, as well as hefty investments in the development of other railroads. It’s thought that the speculative investments involved played a part in the crash. What will you say on the matter in your campaign?"], [4014, "One of President Grant’s biggest roles in the Reconstruction Program has been to prosecute the Ku Klux Klan.

Despite Grant seeing through over 200 indictments and over 100 convictions, many Americans associate his name and party with the scandal. Will you emphasize this scandal in your campaign?"], [4023, "Over the past year, a large debate in Congress has arisen with the fight over the so-called 'Blaine Amendment'.

Will you discuss this in your campaign?"], [1000095, "In a protest of both candidate's support for the Gold Standard, the Greenback Party has nominated inventor Peter Cooper.

How did you not only lose, but not even win any states? How did you lose the south? Texas? Georgia? Arkansas? These states were never going to Hayes, so clearly you did something to cause them to bolt. Your brutal loss has brought solid control of Congress to the Republicans, along with returns showing that local elections, even in the South, are going to the Republicans. With a mandate this large, Reconstruction may be able to continue, with Democrats out of some key local offices in the south.</p><p>Your political career is over, especially with a loss this bad. Forget about renomination, let alone a Congressional run. You will retire, which is likely what you desire anyway.
