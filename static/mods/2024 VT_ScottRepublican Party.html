Your wife Diana gives you a wide smile, and joyously falls into your loving arms. Your daughters embrace you, and your dear Mother Marian tells you how proud she is of you. Somehow, some way, you had turned Howard Dean, Governor Howard Dean, into just another hopeless sacrificial lamb. Another temporary obstacle to the “eternal sunshine of Phil Scott.”</p>
                  <p>What’s more, the supermajority wasn’t just defeated, it was crushed. You watch as Democratic incumbent after incumbent you marked for defeat goes down. The Republicans gain more than enough Senate seats to crack the Democratic two-thirds majority in that chamber, and in the House of Representatives, it’s a net twenty changing hands, landing a decisive defeat to the supermajority that has so bedeviled you. Though amongst the freshmen are right-wing extremists who privately revile you, you know they can only attribute their victory to you leading the ticket. There’s no doubt about it, this election has been won by Phil Scott. The cherry on top is David Zuckerman going down to your ally John Rodgers, you smile knowing his efforts to become Governor will meet a premature end. Dean’s concession call is gracious, but very short, and his shock and shame is obvious.</p>
                  <p>You glance towards the CNN broadcast to see the presidential race playing out, watching Trump march towards victory. You grimace, thinking of that man returning to office. But after so many years of humility and modulating yourself, of avoiding the partisan campaign circuit, you allow yourself some glory instead of worry. The next two years will allow you to write Vermont’s next chapter, one where working people like your father Howard can afford to live, work, and play in the state you so dearly love. You hear your supporters chanting your name in the main hall of the Barre event space. A victorious Senator-elect Scott Beck is exciting the crowd, about to introduce you. This night belongs to you Governor, enjoy it.</p>

                  <p>August 18th, 2026</p> 
                  <p>The result of this week’s primary confirmed what has looked inevitable for a few months now, that this year’s gubernatorial election will be a rematch between Governor Phil Scott (R) and former Lieutenant Governor David Zuckerman (P/D). Both men won their respective parties' nomination for Governor, and will now face each other in the November election.</p>
                  <p>David Zuckerman’s path to the nomination was an unlikely one, especially after losing re-election as Lieutenant Governor to John Rodgers in 2024. But after possible rivals such as Treasurer Mike Pieciak and Secretary of State Sarah Copeland Hanzas passed on running for Governor, instead seeking re-election, his name was the most prominent in the running. Zuckerman faced opposition from Former Mayor of Burlington Miro Weinberger, who argued that a defeated Zuckerman was too weak to win a general election. Weinberger enjoyed support from many Democratic leaders such as Former U.S. Senator Leahy and Former Governor Shumlin, but was nonetheless defeated by Zuckerman by a 3-point margin in the primary. Zuckerman drew upon strong support in southern Vermont, overcoming a defeat in Chittenden County.</p>
                  <p>Scott strolled to the nomination of his party uncontested, after surprising many by deciding to seek a historic sixth term for Governor. Scott argued that critical economic decisions meant that a steady hand is needed at the wheel. Zuckerman has argued that the status quo that has prevailed under Phil Scott is failing Vermonters.</p>
                  <p>The last time these two men faced one another was six years ago, when Phil Scott defeated Zuckerman by 41-points in the midst of a widely praised response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This time the election will take place in more regular circumstances, and both candidates have promised an active and competitive campaign.</p>

                  <p>Cutler: You said in one of our previous sit-downs for this series that your proudest moment as Governor was steering us through COVID-19-</p>
                  <p>Scott: Well, of course this was the most trying time we faced, really by far the most important, we were in the business of saving lives, keeping people safe from a virus we knew little about. It was a scary time, but I was so proud of our state, and especially essential workers. I firmly believe that our response saved thousands of lives, the real credit of course, belongs with Vermonters.</p>
                  <p>Cutler: Right, but I want to mention, I think, another possible moment of pride you took, after the 2024 election, where you defeated Governor Dean by a decisive margin.</p>
                  <p>Scott: (Laughter)</p>
                  <p>Cutler: The legislative session right after that, where you faced a Democratic majority much reduced, and you had a standoff with them.</p>
                  <p>Scott: Well I wouldn’t say we had a standoff. It was certainly a disagreement, absolutely, I mean I think people were saying in that election, we need moderation, we need to be careful about raising costs, we need to refocus on the fundamentals of a strong economy. I was worried that even after that election, that legislative leadership wouldn’t listen to the verdict of the voters, and those worries ended up being correct. They sent me another budget with raised taxes and fees in FY2025, and I had to veto. I said let’s work together to make progress, but we have to look out for working Vermonters, they can’t afford this. I felt I had a mandate to say no, especially after the victories for downballot Republicans.</p>
                  <p>Cutler: And this time, they couldn’t override you.</p>
                  <p>Scott: Yes they couldn’t, and so I called them back into session that summer to really get to work, so we could meet in the middle. This time we did, we passed a budget without raising taxes and fees, we successfully reduced our long-term spending obligations. You mentioned pride, yes, I was very proud of that. I think it was a big win for working Vermonters who really said, we’ve had enough.</p>
                  <p>Cutler: Since then, you’ve had less standoffs, if we use that word, with legislators. Why do you think that is?</p>
                  <p>Scott: I think something changed on their side, I couldn’t tell you what exactly. I know that they chose new legislative leadership, who I’ve worked with very closely. But something changed, and they came to the table, which I really appreciated. Maybe a bit late (laughs) but I appreciated it, and we’ve since gotten a lot of work done to grow our economy, make Vermont more affordable, and protect the most vulnerable. I’m confident in saying we’ve built the foundations for a sustainable economic future for the state we all love. I’m happy with what I’ve left Governor-elect Rodgers, who has been a tremendous partner these last four years</p>

                  <p>November 4th, 2026</p> 
                  <p>Democratic State Treasurer Mike Pieciak cruised to a 20-point victory over Republican Casey Toof Tuesday, making history as Vermont’s first openly LGBT Governor and the first Democrat to occupy the Governor’s office since Peter Shumlin departed in 2017.</p>
                  <p>Introduced by his partner and flanked by his campaign team, Pieciak told the crowd during a 10-minute speech at a Winooski event space that he was humbled to be elected. Pieciak ran a campaign that was widely considered to be moderate and cautious, and further pledged to “continue the good work of Gov. Scott and the legislature.”</p>
                  <p>The crowd and ovation were highly enthusiastic, in part due sweeping victories for legislative Democrats, capturing 101 seats in the House of Representatives and 20 seats in the State Senate. Nationwide, Vermont stood out as a bright spot for Democrats in an otherwise disappointing night, as Democrats failed to retake the Senate and their House majority was reduced to 1 seat, denying President Harris a working majority.</p>
                  <p>Outgoing Governor Phil Scott congratulated Treasurer Pieciak on his victory, offering to work with him for a smooth transition and continuing to implement a joint agenda of “affordability and growth.”</p>

                  <p>VTDigger - Gov. Scott endorses Pieciak for successor, crossing party lines to support Treasurer</p>
                  <p>August 2nd, 2026</p>
                  <p>Governor Phil Scott issued a statement on his campaign account on X.com (formerly known as Twitter) endorsing State Treasurer Mike Pieciak for Governor, Pieciak is currently engaged in a competitive Democratic primary against Lieutenant Governor David Zuckerman. Governor Scott opted not to run for a historic sixth term in May. The statement declared as follows.</p>
                  <p>“This is a very important time for Vermont. In my time as Governor I have attempted to listen and lead with the dignity this state deserves, working towards growing the economy, increasing affordability, and protecting the most vulnerable. In the coming years, Vermont will face challenges including but not limited to housing availability, demographic challenges, and the effects of climate change. Vermont will need leaders who are keenly aware of the fiscal needs of the state, and who will advance policies that are in the best interests of the state.</p>
                  <p>I have worked with Mike Pieciak for many years, including as Treasurer and Commissioner of the Department of Financial Regulation. We worked particularly closely during the COVID-19 pandemic, in days that tested us in ways we could never have expected. I know that Mike is deeply sensible of our state’s fiscal needs, including on housing and demographics, and I have seen up close his attention to detail and ability to bring people together to get stuff done. I know he will make a great Governor, and I want to offer him my full support.</p>
                  <p>Though Mike and I are in different political parties, times like these call upon us to put partisan politics aside to support the best interests of all. I am asking my supporters, whether they be Republicans, Democrats, or Independents, to pull a Democratic ballot in the coming primary and vote for Mike Pieciak. I know he’ll make us proud.</p>
                  <p> Treasurer Pieciak embraced the Governor’s support, saying “while we haven’t agreed on every issue every time, Governor Scott has worked very hard for our state, and his popularity speaks for itself, I’m proud to have his support.” Lieutenant Governor Zuckerman’s campaign released a brief statement saying “we are proud not to have the support of our sitting Republican Governor.”</p>
                  <p>The announcement blindsided Vermont Republican leaders, who are holding their own primary in August. VTGOP Chairman Paul Dame told the Digger that he was “highly disappointed in the Governor’s decision to abandon the Republican Party in this crucial election year.”</p>
                  <p>The primary is a few days away, polling from the University of New Hampshire suggests Pieciak’s lead is within the margin of error.</p>

So when John Klar organized his doomed tax revolt, you weren’t surprised. But you took that risk when you sat down with the Democrats to hammer out a compromise on education taxes. Because developing a real policy solution to real problems was worth it. Because that’s what real mavericks do. With your approach, you’ve actually bridged the partisan divide and brought people together towards a moderate consensus that truly does grow the economy, make Vermont more affordable, and yes, protect the most vulnerable.</p>
                  <p>When the dust settles on election night, it seems like Donald Trump, the Monster, will again be President. But you’re ready, ready to defend Vermont. Ready to make a stand for the Republican Party of your father Howard, a World War Two veteran and a truly decent man. In the Green Mountain State, the Party of Lincoln is not yet lost. Phil Baruth and Jill Krowinski call you on Thursday to discuss the agenda for the coming legislative session, ready to craft a bipartisan agenda for the benefit of all. Vermont has its defender, and his name is Phillip Brian Scott.</p>

                  <p>Jason Gibbs, who has served as Chief of Staff to Governor Phil Scott since 2017, has resigned from his position effective immediately, citing a “respectful difference of perspective” with Governor Scott, while wishing the Governor and his team “whom I respect immensely” the best going forward.</p>
                  <p>Jason Gibbs has been known for his combative personality, prodigious intelligence, small government ideas, and willingness to directly and sharply respond to critics of the Governor, many in Montpelier have cited the “abrasive” Chief of Staff’s attitude as one of the reasons for rocky relations between the Governor and the legislature. </p>
                  <p>Governor Scott wished Gibbs the best, thanking him for 8 years of “diligent and thoughtful” service. </p>
                  <p>Sources in Montpelier indicated that the Governor and his Chief of Staff broke significantly on legislative strategy during the 2024 legislative session, and that Gibbs strongly opposed Governor Scott’s education compromise with Democrats during the session. Subsequently, Gibbs took a backseat in decision-making on the Fifth Floor. </p>
                  <p>Scott previously characterized the relationship between the two as, "we don't agree on everything. We have our own debates. But in the end, I win, you know, because I'm governor — and that's the way it is." The Governor seemingly did have his way in this case.</p>
                  <p>Democratic leaders have yet to comment but anonymous Democratic sources indicated their pleasure at the news. Governor Scott has indicated he plans to renew bipartisan talks to see what compromises can be reached with reconciling affordability and emissions goals.</p>

                  <p>We the people of Vermont have been betrayed by our elected representatives too many times to stay silent. Phil Scott looked us in the eye and told us he would not raise our taxes. But he did, and that wasn’t the only promise he broke. There has been a pattern of disrespect and disregard exhibited by the Governor for his entire term of office. He has refused to vote for our Republican nominees for President, or support our statewide Republican slate. So, we conservative Vermont Republicans have resolved to fight back. Today we form the Independent Republican Party.</p>
                  <p>We are Republicans, we support our President, Donald Trump, and we support limited government, law and order, and traditional Christian values. What we are not are Phil Scott R.I.N.O. 's (Republican in Name Only) who push liberal policy and ask Republican voters to accept crumbs, and call them ungrateful when they demand better. We’re at risk of losing our state, and we demand that our leaders do more to stop Vermont’s transformation into New Jersey. We don’t want Phil Scott, who is about as conservative as fellow R.I.N.O. Mitt Romney, we want conservative leadership like Donald Trump, Elon Musk, and J.D. Vance. </p>
                  <p>We will chiefly run candidates in Republican primaries to get conservatives elected. What we want is a unified conservative Republican Party. If things change, we will happily rejoin our party, the party of Reagan and Trump. But like the Green Mountain Boys, we aren’t afraid of a little rebellion, and so we won’t hesitate to run candidates outside of Republican primaries if we’re disrespected.</p>

                  <p>Governor Howard Dean did not mince words when discussing the Unborn Life Protection Act, known to most as the national abortion ban, legislation recently signed by President Trump to restrict all abortion procedures performed after 6 weeks.</p>
                  <p>At a press conference at the State House on Thursday Governor Dean was asked to elaborate on his repeated condemnations of the bill as it proceeded through Congress now that it has been signed into law. Dean was direct with journalists, saying “I will absolutely never surrender the right of Vermont women to control their own bodies.” Dean stated that he will not enforce the law in Vermont, a sentiment that Attorney General Charity Clark repeated in her statement yesterday.</p>
                  <p>Dean did not stop there, he further said that he would resist any efforts by the federal authorities to enforce the law in Vermont. Describing Vermont as a “fortress of resistance” Dean pledged to deploy the National Guard to defend abortion clinics if necessary and arrest any federal agents who seek to enforce the legislation in Vermont. He also offered an invitation to those seeking abortions from other states to come to Vermont to seek reproductive treatment.</p>
                  <p>Responding to concerns that this would constitute an unconstitutional act of nullification, Dean said he was unconcerned; “Vermonters come first, our rights are not up for negotiation."</p>
                  <p>Federal authorities have not commented on Dean’s remarks, or the statements of other Democratic state officials vowing to oppose the law.</p>

The mood at your Barre election night event is the most tense it ever has been. Even you're worried, bouncing your knee and tapping the table. If you lose, it’s more than just politics, it’ll be a statement that partisanship and grandstanding is more important than getting things done.</p>
                  <p>As the night proceeds, you witness your fears be slowly realized. The pit in your stomach grows. Dean is in the lead, and John Klar’s right-wing revolt is slicing into your vote share. You hold out hope for remaining vote batches from Washington County to save you, but it’s not enough. John Klar has stolen your base out from under you. It’s almost 11, the reality of defeat setting in, when you suggest calling Dean. You and your closest staffers are sitting around recounting old campaign stories, your staffers and friends, some of whom have been with you for 10 years or more, meekly accept. You call up Howard, he’s gracious, as are you. You concede, you wish him the best. After brief, gracious remarks to your disappointed supporters, you’re in bed not long after.</p>
                  <p>The next morning, you wake up early to take the dogs for a walk. Neighbors walking dogs say hi, the air is cool, the dead leaves crunch under your feet. Vermont is still the same as yesterday. You’ve got more than a few unanswered texts and calls to respond to but you’re not terribly anxious about responding. Perhaps it’s even Gibbs, telling you all that you did wrong.</p>
                  <p>Compromise and pragmatism may have lost today, you knew you took a risk when you sat down with the Democrats to negotiate a deal on education taxes, but it will not lose in the end. You can only hope that your efforts helped build a Vermont where ordinary working-class folks, people like your father Howard, can afford to live and build a family and enjoy the blessings of the Green Mountain State.</p>

The first few years of childhood development are so crucial, crucial for everything. Universal Pre-K is worth every cent, because we’re investing in our future. </p>

                <p>August 25th, 2032</p>
                <p>Millions of people across this country are coming together to support Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s bid for President of the United States, regardless of party or background. Because this is about our country, not partisan differences.</p>
                <p>“Republicans for Alexandria” is a coalition of Republicans who support a government for, of, and by the people, and not for special interests or political extremists. They see how the Republican Party has lost its way. You don’t have to agree with Alexandria on everything, but this isn’t about that, it’s about the people of the United States.</p>
                <p>Former Governor Phil Scott of Vermont (2017-2025) agrees; “I don’t agree with Senator Cortez on much, but this is bigger than that. President Trump has shown a dangerous disrespect for our democratic institutions, and in many ways is even more demogaugic and uncivil than his father. We can do better, I know this because Alexandria reached out to me to talk about the issues, even if we didn’t agree. That takes leadership.”</p>
                <p>This courageous group also includes former Nebraska State Senator John S. McCollister and former Pennsylvania Congressman Charlie Dent. </p>

For 8 years Phil Scott defended the interests of landlords and developers while persecuting workers, renters, and sufferers of long COVID. He hallowed out public services, shamelessly supported the Israeli genocide in Gaza, and gentrified working-class Vermonters out of their neighborhoods. Despite all this, he was adored by bourgeois liberals who admired his “civility” and performative opposition to fascism. In truth, Phil Scott was fascism with a human face.</p>
                      <p>Now we have Howard Dean, a geriatric middle-class liberal who stabbed Bernie Sanders in the back (as Bernie has stabbed Palestinians in the back with his support for Israel), and spent his career advocating for austerity and tax cuts for the rich. Look no further than Dean himself, who joked that in his time as Governor, many said that a Republican Governor was unnecessary, Vermont already had Dean. No doubt Dean will continue Phil Scott’s policies of gentrifying Burlington neighborhoods and selling the city to developers, as well as support for the fascist Burlington Police Department.</p>

                        <p>Vermont Governor and Former DNC Chair Howard Dean disagreed with President Harris in a rare criticism of his own party in a press conference this week.</p>
                        <p>Dean was asked his thoughts on the recent 300 million dollar weapons sale approved by President Harris’ Department of Defense to the Israeli Defense Forces, and in his response he did not hesitate to criticize the President, who spoke with Prime Minister Gantz on the phone this week to formalize the details of the arrangement.</p>
                        <p>“I’m certainly glad that Israeli voters dumped the Netanyahu government, which was really a violently nationalist government, if we’re being honest certainly bent on ethnic cleansing or worse, but I think we really have to start asking ourselves what these weapons sales are accomplishing, and if they’re living up to our values regardless. I have been concerned by how little the new cabinet has done to restrain the violence in the West Bank, where settlers have been terrorizing locals, or for the welfare of the people of Gaza, where reconstruction efforts are languishing.”</p>
                        <p>Governor Dean’s remarks were condemned by AIPAC on their social media outlets, but received praise from Former U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy, and were defended emphatically by former Lt.

                        <p>Former Governor Phil Scott released a statement to the press, with the Digger receiving the first copy, announcing his departure from the Republican Party. Scott served as Governor of Vermont from 2017 to 2025, leaving office after being defeated in the Republican primary by conservative challenger John Klar, who would go on to lose the general election to Howard Dean. </p>
                        <p>Governor Scott’s statement declared his disaffiliation from the Vermont Republican Party and his new affiliation as an “independent Vermonter.” His statement read as follows:</p>
                        <p>“For all my political life, I have been a proud Republican. I have campaigned for Republican candidates, represented my neighbors in the State Senate for Washington County as a Republican, and sought the Republican nomination for statewide office.</p>
                        <p>Before I entered politics, I didn’t have a political bone in my body, party politics was something entirely foreign to me. I decided to enter politics because I felt that government wasn’t working for working Vermonters, and it was difficult to make ends meet as a business owner trying to live the American Dream. I felt the Republican Party fit those aspirations best. I have always greatly admired leaders and statesmen like George H. W. Bush, John McCain, and Mitt Romney who I felt advanced that idea of what it meant to be a Republican.</p>
                        <p>When Donald Trump became President, I was saddened to see where my party had gone. But I felt optimistic that the moderate, sensible, wing of the party could return to strength, and could define the future of my party. Given the likely nomination of Donald Trump for a fourth time for President this year, I sadly must acknowledge this hasn’t happened, and isn’t likely to happen. The Republican Party today treats compromise as a dirty word, and advances a radical, cruel vision of this country that demonizes women, LGBT people, and racial minorities. It has become a personality cult for one man who doesn’t care about our laws or our democratic system. I used to feel that by staying in the party, I could make it better, but I no longer feel this way.</p>
                        <p>So I have decided to join the majority of my fellow Vermonters who identify as political independents. We stand for centrism, moderation, and compromise, and we’re not afraid to say so. We find that neither party represents us properly, and judge candidates on their merits, not their partisan affiliation. My values have not changed, this decision is about where my former party has gone. So now I call myself an independent Vermonter. This is where I’ll stand, and this is where I’ll stay.”</p>
                        <p>Governor Dean commented in his weekly press conference on this news, saying “I have always respected Governor Scott an incredible amount, and this truly proves he is one of the best and most thoughtful among us.”</p>
                        <p>VTGOP Chair Mike Tagliavia told the Digger that “Governor Scott’s legacy is failure. He can say whatever he likes as a private citizen, he functionally hasn’t been a Republican for years anyway.”</p>
