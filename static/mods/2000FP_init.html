For the first time since Grover Cleveland, there will be a president that serves two non-consecutive terms. Who will it be? Will it be Jimmy Carter, the 39th President who served from 1977 to 1981? Or will it be George H.W. Bush, the 41st President who served from 1989 to 1993? <p>The main issues of the race will be the budget surplus, education, and some tension occurring in the Middle East. Both candidates will have to use these issues to their advantages, and convince the public that while they may have been rejected for a second term previously, they are up to return to the job in 2000.</p>",

His greatest achievements during his presidency are in foreign policy, including the Gulf War and ending the Cold War with the now defunct Soviet Union. Bush lost re-election to outgoing President Bill Clinton, but some may say that it is a result of the candidacy of conservative Texas businessman Ross Perot as well as some economic trouble back in the early 1990s. The Democrats currently have the advantage of the economy judging by the current surplus. However, the Republicans hope that Bush can redeem himself from that loss in an open, neutral environment and can use his strong foreign policy credentials to lead the country through some of the current issues in the Middle East.</p>",

Many Americans may fear that his presidency could reverse the economic growth that the country has seen throughout the Clinton administration. Since his loss in 1980, Carter has taken part in a lot of humanitarian work, and the general public has viewed him more favorably since then. Carter could use the high popularity of Bill Clinton to his advantage, as well as the current state of the economy to redeem himself from the blistering loss of his twenty years ago. However, Ralph Nader's third-party campaign could hand the election to Bush if Carter goes too moderate to win over Southern voters.</p>",
