But in the end, Boutwell maintained his composure in the hearings, and the charges failed to stick before the scandal was washed away by your happy swearing-in. Quite a secret to hold, Admiral, and quite the people to share it with. You may want to be more careful in the future. But you’ve become President, and it’s time to move past the campaign into a brighter American century. Godspeed, Admiral!</p>"

You’ve vanquished both foes, and taken full command of the Democratic party, with a narrow majority in the House. With the party insiders caught flat-footed by your victory and the Southern wing in shock at their sudden loss of power, you have a precious moment to reshape the Democratic party to your visions -- perhaps, under the leadership of the good Admiral -- the party, and the country, can truly live up to its founding principles once more.

What direction will you sail the Democrats -- and the country -- in? It’s up to you now, Admiral -- the S.S. Columbia is at your command.</p>"
