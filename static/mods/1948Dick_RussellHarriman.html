You now have the chance to fix many of the foreign policy disasters undergone by Wallace and reaffirm American strength to all our foes and allies. Economically plans are already being drawn up for a new round of New Deal legislation, with a more conservative tone than those proposed by Wallace, and you can finally secure the legacy of FDR, and perhaps even make a legacy of your own. You must also carefully deal with the China crisis which could threaten to consume your administration.
