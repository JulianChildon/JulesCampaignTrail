Epton renews his pledge to serve only one term, while saying that he looks forward to finding common cause with city council.

The world feels turned upside down, and it’s all much <em>realer</em> than the primary win. Advisor after advisor, on top of the world — with a Black community hailing you as a savior — deliver bold plans to dump the old guard after all the years of its dominance. You’re tempted to agree, remarking to one aid that you’ll “throw them all out of power” — but you understand once no-longer high off victory that you’ll need allies.

At an informal City Council meeting a week after your victory, the now-diminished Cook County Chairman Alderman Ed Vrdolyak declares that while the election may be over, there’s still a war between yourself and party regulars. Vrdolyak says that you intend to dump the old guard and replace them with loyal foot soldiers, and many of his fellow White regulars concur. When a Black regular tries to inquire Eddie on what he means, exactly, after the meeting — particularly since you chose machiner Wilson Frost to represent you in the city council — she finds most of the council’s white aldermen in his office. You must be weary: these men supported Epton, no matter what they may say publicly, and they likely won't end their efforts to derail your Mayoralty with your election.</p>`]

Epton renews his pledge to serve only one term, while saying that he looks forward to finding common cause with city council.

Advisor after advisor, on top of the world — with a Black community hailing you as a savior — deliver bold plans to dump the old guard after all the years of its dominance. You’re tempted to agree, remarking to one aid that you’ll “throw them all out of power” — but you understand once no-longer high off victory that you’ll need allies.

At an informal City Council meeting a week after your victory, the now-diminished Cook County Chairman Alderman Ed Vrdolyak declares that while the election may be over, there’s still a war between yourself and party regulars. Vrdolyak says that you intend to dump the old guard and replace them with loyal foot soldiers, and many of his fellow White regulars concur. When a Black regular tries to inquire Eddie on what he means, exactly, after the meeting — particularly since you chose machiner Wilson Frost to represent you in the city council — she finds most of the council’s white aldermen in his office. You must be weary: these men supported Epton, no matter what they may say publicly, and they likely won't end their efforts to derail your mayoralty with your election.</p>`]
