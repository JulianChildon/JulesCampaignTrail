It also gave brief, if a little unfounded hope for Conservative voters that their party could actually end up first in the election regardless. In the second round, the Social Democrats swept the single-member constituencies and ended up as the largest party with 52 seats - even more than LVŽS in 2016 or TS-LKD in 2020.<br><br>The Social Democrats claim that this was an enormous victory - and, indeed, this is the party's best performance in history - but pre-election polls actually showed them considerably higher than they actually ended up. Meanwhile, despite finishing third, NA is unquestionably one of the election's winners - overperforming expectations and sending a large delegation to the Seimas, trembling the political landscape in the same manner that many of their predecessors have. Their parliamentarians come from all walks of life, however - from Social Democrats, Order and Justice, Labour, Peasants, Liberals and even one MP who began their political career in Freedom. How long can this construct last? God knows.<br><br><strong>Vilija Blinkevičiūtė</strong> announced her refusal to be nominated Prime Minister after the election, against her pre-election promises, and nominated <strong>Gintautas Paluckas</strong> of the party's progressive wing to take her stead. This caused a backlash among right-wing media and pundits and lasted for a few days on the airwaves before the country moved on to coalition troubles.<br><br><strong>The Coalition:</strong> As the election ended, LSDP immediately announced a coalition with DSVL, but lacking a majority together, they had to bring in a third partner for a majority. Their first choice was to bring in LVŽS - again, to the disappointment of right-wing media. However, this option only lasted for a few days, as a plethora of bad blood arose between LVŽS and DSVL - old wounds from splitting apart and personal conflicts, which ultimately made the coalition untenable.<br><br>Briefly, the Social Democrats considered adding the Liberals, but one meeting with their leader Čmilytė dashed those prospects, as both parties agreed that they have little in common in domestic affairs. With most options exhausted and Paluckas refusing to consider a minority government, the Social Democrats turned to NA. As of the time this was written, a coalition agreement has been signed between LSDP-DSVL-NA, against fierce backlash from the 'Right', from certain international partners, and from the President. Protests and counter-protests are planned, all while Žemaitaitis continues to melt down in Facebook, describing Conservatives as 'the new Lithuanian Hamas'.<br><br>Where do we go from here? Nobody really knows.</p><br><br>\", \"has_visits\": 0, \"no_electoral_majority_image\": \"/static/images/2012-no-majority.jpg\"}}]");

It gathers a lot of its support among Polish and Russian speaking voters and its mere existence frightens the political establishment. However, even if they miraculously get a candidate elected, they are guaranteed to be isolated during the term.<br><button onclick='back0()'>Back</button></p></span><span id='screen4' style='display: none;'><li><b>Name: National Alliance (NS)</b></li><p>The National Alliance was established in 2020 by the eurosceptic national conservative philosopher Vytautas Radžvilas - who had unsuccessfully ran for the European Parliament a year earlier with a vow to “reclaim the state”. It is against LGBT rights, immigration and European institution interference in national policy, and it deliberately positions itself against the TS-LKD, which it claims no longer represents true conservatism.<br><br>The NS stands out from its right-wing contemporaries by being urban-focused - its voters lean younger than LVŽS or NA, and much of its leadership are right-wing intellectuals and young activists. In this, it can be compared to the early years of the Alternative for Germany, both in leadership and in its opposition to the centre-right. Much like in 2020, NS does not expect to win, but it hopes to make a strong showing if the TS-LKD leans too liberal.<br><button onclick='back0()'>Back</button></p></span><span id='screen5' style='display: none;'><li><b>Name: Coalition of Peace</b></li><p>The Peace Coalition is a coalition list of three parties, led by the populist and personalist Labour Party. Prior to this election, Labour was one of the heavy hitters of Lithuanian politics and performed admirably in the 2020 election, where they gathered ten percent of the vote. Since then, however, the party has completely collapsed (again), almost all of its MPs have either departed for other parties or are running as independents, and even Viktor Uspaskich's return as party chairman hasn't improved its polling.<br><br>Desperate to hold on to at least one seat, Labour runs together with the Samogitian Party and the Christian Democracy Party - two small, right-wing, anti-systemic parties, both of which are opposed to support for Ukraine. This is also the message of the whole Coalition - the 'peace' they seek is undoubtedly peace in Ukraine, at Ukraine's expense. Even together, however, the Coalition seems guaranteed to stay far behind the 5% electoral barrier.<br><button onclick='back0()'>Back</button></p></span><span id='screen6' style='display: none;'><li><b>Name: Lithuanian Green Party (LŽP)</b></li><p>The Green Party was established in 2011 and exists as a small centre-left environmentalist party to this day. It is opposed to nuclear energy and supported the decommission of Lithuania’s only nuclear power plant in Ignalina, it supports green politics, progressive taxation and same-sex partnerships. Most of its voters are in the cities, although it also has attracted several high-profile figures in the regions.<br><br>Their only MP, former Social Democratic prime minister Algirdas Butkevičius, defected to the Democrats, leaving the LŽP unlikely to enter parliament for the first time since their foundation. It has begun doubling down on its progressivism, seeking to capture dissatisfied liberal votes and perhaps surpass Freedom as the leaders of progressivism in Lithuania - as unlikely as that may be.<br><button onclick='back0()'>Back</button></p></span>\", \"color_hex\": \"#00C100\", \"secondary_color_hex\": \"#A1FFA1\", \"is_active\": 1, \"image_url\": \"https://i.imgur.com/8AMxkfy.png\", \"electoral_victory_message\": \"''\", \"electoral_loss_message\": \"''\", \"no_electoral_majority_message\": \"''\", \"description_as_running_mate\": \"''\", \"candidate_score\": 0.0}}]");
