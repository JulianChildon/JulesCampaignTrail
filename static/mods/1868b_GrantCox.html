You‚Äôve managed to win the election with the Radical Sumner by your side. You have achieved the final victory in the long road of the abolitionist movement. Sumner has already taken the lead, pressuring you to implement radical solutions and further crackdown on racial violence. Southern Democrats have already begun protesting this victory and KKK attacks have drastically increased, fearing the worst with the election of your Vice President. \n<br><br>You have managed to secure a Republican majority in Congress and several Radical congressmen have already begun preparing for a revote on the failed thirteenth amendment and even a proposed equal rights amendment which is set to secure the rights of freedmen and blacks from the oppression of states. No matter what you will have a busy four years ahead of you with the South growing more and more uppity by the year, but if all goes well you should hopefully win reelection in four years.\n</p>",
