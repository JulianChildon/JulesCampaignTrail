Perhaps the checks of businesses, pleased by his association with honest, god fearing men of Northern stock who they didn’t view as raging loons, and his fiscal conservatism, somehow pushed him over. Grant certainly must have stumbled somehow, perhaps moderating in ways that attracted Radicals to Chase’s side. But still, it is positively a marvel that Chase has won the presidency, that which he has desired for decades at this point. Good for him! He would enjoy it more than you ever would.</p><p>As President, Chase will likely begin to slow Reconstruction, though he has whole heartedly endorsed a suffrage amendment, already frustrating our party. You doubt he’ll win renomination-doubtlessly his running mate already plots against him. But he will lower our taxes, begin to ameliorate the sticky currency situation, and return rule of this nation to the states, where it belongs. At least on economics, he fits our party perfectly, and that is satisfying enough. You, Governor, may have a hand in his administration-Chase will likely hope for your legitimacy and call upon you in State or Treasury.

Even with his running mate’s ravings, he found no audience to really swing the vote in his favor, as our party faithful had no interest in a man so committed whole heartedly to the idea of equality. Grant took the lead easily, ballooned by men who actually were from his own party, and thus took the presidency with little resistance. It seems that being a good justice for Johnson was no aid to Justice Chase.</p><p>Where Chase goes now is not your problem. He resigned his justiceship to undertake this fool’s errand, and now he’ll likely spend the rest of his days in repose, rejoicing in his expansion of suffrage across the whole nation. You, on the other hand, may actually have a more active hand in politics. It is clear that Chase’s selection by the Committee was a disaster, but something must come next.

Not a winning one, mind you, for the General will soon be elected by the House.

You detest the thought, knowing it would split us wide open, but if he was so successful it must do something. Perhaps 1872 will be another horror show at the DNC…. but if it is they shall not call upon you. You shall stay home, at Utica, and if somebody comes to ask you to campaign you shall send them away.

But the perfidious Congress has had other designs. Claiming voter fraud, the House and Senate have both agreed not to count the votes of Georgia, arguing it was delivered purely by fraud and violence. You are incensed, knowing that the Republicans engage in the same calumny up North and choose not to censure themselves. The House now meets, where it shall certainly elect General Grant President.</p><p>You are ready to go home, but your supporters surely not. This is their country, their land. The Republicans cannot simply steal an election as they have attempted to here. All across the South, the Seymour Knights and Ku Klux Klan take up their lances and rifles. Grant may have beaten them on the battlefield, but he is far weaker now. He certainly cannot defeat them again. So soon after the last war were our wounds once again reopened. You do your best to conceal your horror, but the violence that is about to ensue will be unspeakable. God save us all.</p>"

Yet now you have somehow, against perhaps your will, won the White House! Grant’s campaign crumpled under the weight of both your attacks and his party’s radicalism. Seeing his perfidy, the American people have chosen you, you, to lead them! With your victory Reconstruction’s end is all but assured, and the wretched push for black suffrage is likely dead in its tracks, even if the Lame Duck Congress may attempt to pass it.</p><p>You shall be faced with a Republican Congress, but the tide of history is on your side. With your victory you have sealed shut the Radical dreams of black equality, even if your triumph is so slim. Getting this far at all, so far that the Republicans’ plan to deny you Georgia’s electoral votes for fraud fell flat, was not more than a dream. You shall enter the White House and make it Whiter, knowing that the American people believed in you and your vision. Lincoln’s legacy is in tatters, as you ready yourself to sleep in his old bed. Dreams of Democratic control shall fly through your head, as you know your victory has swept aside all your old foe hoped for.</p>"

The next four years shall see the end of Reconstruction, the return of Southern rule to the South, immense amounts of hand-wringing on Reconstruction, and all the stresses of the Presidency you hoped to avoid. Good luck!</p><p>Already, the North cries fraud, claiming your victory was delivered at swordpoint in the South, not by legitimate means. Let them whine. You have redeemed your party, and showed the Republicans the cold hard truth of this nation. They are not the party of the White Man, and that is who America belongs to. With your election, they shall rule again, bringing the freedmen under their heel, barring them the vote, and elevating them above all other inferiors. In the future, when they speak of the Great Founders of this nation, they shall say three names. Washington, Jefferson, and Seymour.</p>"
