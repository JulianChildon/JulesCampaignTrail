The TPP insisted on a margin of error of 3%, with a range of plus or minus 1.5%, while the KMT argued that each poll should be calculated based on its own determined maximum margin of error. For example, Formosa Poll indicated a maximum sampling error of ±3.0% at a 95% confidence level, totaling 6%. Now, at this crucial moment deciding Taiwan's fate, how do you perceive the negotiations reaching a deadlock?",

Ko Wen-je, who had surpassed both Hou Yu-ih and Lai Ching-te in previous polls, only received less than 25% of the votes. The reality was harsh, and that night, these young individuals grew up, realizing that strength in their own world did not necessarily translate to strength in the broader political arena...</p><p>Of course, it was expected that TPP wouldn't win the presidency in this election. On the spot, you announced your intention to participate in the next presidential election in 2028, indicating that there's still a political future for you.

As the final stage of the election passed, the steadfast support of the youth who remained loyal to you persisted, with the belief that Ko Wen-je would become the next president, bringing a new era of politics to Taiwan. On January 13th, when the election results were revealed, the unexpected happened: Hou You-yi and the KMT surpassed both you and Lai Ching-te. What happened on November 23rd must have affected the current outcome, leading to your vote percentage being below 25%. Winning the presidency remains a distant dream. The KMT, once disdained by you, reclaimed the presidential position. The 8-year curse continues, and the eyes of the youth who supported you were filled with tears that night. They grew up and matured, becoming adults in the political world. They realized how cruel reality could be, not just in their own strong world, but also outside...</p> <p>Although your vote percentage wasn't very high, no one expected a victory in this election. At least it shook the future of the two-party system and the KMT government. On the spot, you announced your participation in the next 2028 presidential election, signaling that there's still a role for you to play. Your party gained significant visibility and government subsidies in this election, with each vote equivalent to a subsidy of 30 NTD. In the Legislative Yuan, you secured 8 at-large legislators. Unfortunately, none were elected in specific constituencies. Nevertheless, your influence in the parliament has expanded, which is a positive development.</p><p>Looking ahead, without the position of mayor or the spotlight of a presidential candidate, you are now just a party chairman. Figuring out how to increase exposure and help the TPP gain more local governance in 2026 is a crucial consideration for your party. Best of luck to you, Chairman Ko, in 2026 and 2028!</p><h3>Ke’s defeat speech:</h3><p>This election, amidst the blue-green competition, saw many people willing to step forward despite the challenging circumstances.

However, reality proved them all wrong. Despite Hou You-yi and Zhao Shao-kang boosting the KMT's prospects, the erosion of Lai Ching-te's support base and your party's excellent early campaign operations allowed you to maintain around 30% support in the final month. On election day, it was almost unbelievable; Ko Wen-je and Lai Ching-te, Hou You-yi were neck-and-neck in the vote count. After two hours, Ko Wen-je established a stable lead, and the hearts of young people pounded with excitement. They knew they were witnessing a new history and a new politics in Taiwan. A five-year-old party defeated the two major parties, KMT and DPP, in the presidential election. In that moment, with tears in their eyes, they chose to believe in miracles, to believe in risking it all for once!</p><p>The victory of the TPP and Ko Wen-je in the presidential race marks a new era in Taiwanese politics. On May 20, you will form a new government, securing 10 at-large legislative seats in the Legislative Yuan, and even winning one regional seat in the first electoral district of Taichung. Unfortunately, other regional candidates did not succeed due to their limited local foundations. Nevertheless, your influence in the parliament has expanded, which is a positive development. However, Taiwan has never seen such a small majority in the presidency. You will need to collaborate with both blue and green camps to pass any legislation, signifying that your governance will be constrained. Nonetheless, it also provides an opportunity to realize your vision of a coalition government and a united cabinet!</p><p>Looking ahead, what image will you shape for Taiwan? How should relations progress among China, the United States, and Taiwan? Economic, domestic, and energy policies, defense, and diplomacy are all challenges that the young TPP must confront. Winning the election is only the first step; governing the country is a more difficult task. How to secure more regional governance for the TPP in 2026 is something you and your party need to carefully consider. If you succeed, you might attempt re-election in 2028. Wishing you the best of luck in 2026 and 2028, President Ko Wen-je!</p></div>"
