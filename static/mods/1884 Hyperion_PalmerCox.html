But as the campaign progressed, and you demonstrated a greater openness to economic progressivism, his attitude changed. He said, during one rally, that, should his party carry any states, he would be willing to ‘work with the party that can promise the greatest commitment to the social and economic progress of the American nation.’</p><p>A deal may still be in reach.

While the budding progressive movement was at times frustrated by your conservative stance on the economic issues of the day, they at least welcome your commitment to reform, and to thrifty and honest government. Across the country, Americans look forward to a return to sound economic governance, and you know Tilden will be able to rest easy, his legacy secure.</p><p>You can almost imagine Conkling’s fury; that his clout within the gilded halls of power could not help him where he needed it most; with the American people, who have now rejected you. It’s a given that, as you receive these results, he is plotting his survival within his party, and, if he can manage that, his revenge. He will do everything in his power to claw his way back to the nomination in four years, to take his shot at you once more. But that’s for him to worry about. It is now time to grant the wishes of the people; reform and honesty in government, a lifting of the tax burden, and a drawing-down of Conkling’s empire. You have much to do, President-elect Palmer, but the people have given you their full trust. May you serve well.</p>"
