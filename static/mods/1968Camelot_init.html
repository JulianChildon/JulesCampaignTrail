As such, he felt awful about the whole situation and that paranoia would spread throughout his mind, but despite his fears, a flame within his heart would grow, the flame to preserve his brother's legacies.<p>The flame would grow viscously when he met with his father in the aftermath of the shooting, where the old man pleaded with his son in his shaky voice to run. He was in no position to yell and throw around his weight, but his influence still hung around like an aura.
