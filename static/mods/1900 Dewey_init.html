The rebound has dimmed the flames of the Free Silver movement, and Democratic party insiders seized their opportunity to topple the charismatic Boy Orator and replace him with someone more malleable. <br><br>At the convention in Kansas City, bosses and operatives worked together to block the seemingly inevitable nomination of William Jennings Bryan, though he remains the towering leader of the party's progressive wing. The nomination instead falls to the admirable Admiral George Dewey, veteran of the recent war and hero of the Battle of Manila Bay.</p><p><ul><li>William McKinley starts with the lead, having overseen the economic turnaround and the war victory. He will defend his record as a staunch imperialist and a committed tariff man.</li><li>George Dewey, while well-respected as a military man, has little political experience or knowledge, and is prone to gaffes. He will need a smart campaign and some lucky breaks in order to convince the American people to put such an outsider in the White House.</li></ul></p><p>This election will center around tariffs, the relationship between business and labor, social issues, and foreign policy, particularly the ongoing Philippine-American War.</p></div>","image_url":"https://i.imgur.com/zyfLO7g.png","winning_electoral_vote_number":224,"advisor_url":"https://i.imgur.com/jdV8hDm.png","recommended_reading":"<ul>\n<li><a href=https://www.chicagotribune.com/opinion/editorials/ct-edit-chicago-tribune-biden-endorsement-20200925-lnyxsb5qvrftnjjmj3rnzj33jy-story.html>Our Case For Joe Biden</a></li>\n<li><a href=https://nationalinterest.org/feature/case-trump-166808>The Case For Trump</a></li>\n<li><a href=https://www.npr.org/2020/11/18/935730100/how-biden-won-ramping-up-the-base-and-expanding-margins-in-the-suburbs>How Biden Won: Ramping Up The Base And Expanding Margins In The Suburbs</a></li>\n<li><a href=https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/politics/donald-trump-joe-biden-us-election-almost-win-votes-concede>Why Did Trump Almost Win?</a></li>\n<li><a href=https://www.hoover.org/research/no-evidence-voter-fraud-guide-statistical-claims-about-2020-election>No Evidence For Voter Fraud: A Guide To Statistical Claims About The 2020 Election</a></li>\n</ul>","has_visits":0,"no_electoral_majority_image":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/United_States_Capitol_Building_Interior_1860.png"}}];e.temp_election_list = [{"id":5,"year":1896,"is_premium":0,"display_year":"1900 Dewey"}];e.credits = "u/dcmetro7; special thanks to u/tom1923 for creating the banner image, and to everyone who helped playtest over on discord; shoutout to u/StockdaleForTCT for keeping Deweymania alive";e.global_parameter_json = [{"model":"campaign_trail.global_parameter","pk":1,"fields":{"vote_variable":1.125,"max_swing":0.12,"start_point":0.94,"candidate_issue_weight":10,"running_mate_issue_weight":3,"issue_stance_1_max":-0.71,"issue_stance_2_max":-0.3,"issue_stance_3_max":-0.125,"issue_stance_4_max":0.125,"issue_stance_5_max":0.3,"issue_stance_6_max":0.71,"global_variance":0.01,"state_variance":0.005,"question_count":25,"default_map_color_hex":"#C9C9C9","no_state_map_color_hex":"#999999"}}];e.candidate_json = [{"model":"campaign_trail.candidate","pk":20,"fields":{"first_name":"William","last_name":"McKinley","election":5,"party":"Republican","state":"Ohio","priority":1,"description":"Dummy Example is a veteran from Hell.
