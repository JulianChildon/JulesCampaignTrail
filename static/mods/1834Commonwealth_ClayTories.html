			Commonwealth was a setting originally made for a Political Simulation, known as Polsim5. I just REALLY wanted a good, Parliamentary America simulation. America has such cool geography and history, and I always thought that a geniune multi-party nation would be great. <br></br> Around some early point, Onkel Danny suggested it become a timeline where Cromwell wins and America is intensely Puritan. His original idea was 1912, and the timeline take place somewhere around World War 1 in a hilariously messed up world, but I was wayyyy too lazy and just gave up after 1830. <br></br> Conclusively, PS5 was a total and complete nightmare. It sucked and crashed and burned. I have never, since that point, been more disappointed in how a project ended. But here you are, playing a mod based on it!`;

Coding isnt as hard as I thought it would be, but making a functional map from the SVG that Revan made, shout out Revan, was very hard and required great work from Diamondy to make functional.
