However, at that time, the DPP had the so-called four-year rule, which stipulated that comrades within the party could not run for different public offices within four years, which was set up by the DPP in order to maintain a fair distribution of the limited political resources and to avoid the speculative mentality of riding on a donkey in search of a horse, Because Chen Shui-bian had previously chosen to run for mayor of Taipei, he was theoretically unable to participate in the party primaries for the presidential election. However, because Chen Shui-bian has a high degree of public opinion and is no longer in office, some DPP members are interested in amending the four-year clause for Chen Shui-bian. Chen Shui-bian himself publicly appealed to his comrades in the DPP not to customize the rules for him, and also verbally expressed his support for Hsu Hsin-liang's candidacy. However, in the end, with the strong support of powerful people such as Huang Hsin-suke, the DPP was able to modify the four-year terms to allow Chen Shui-bian to run in the election.
